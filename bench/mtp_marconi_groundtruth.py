"""Capture serial (batch=1, MTP) multi-turn agentic outputs for A/B vs Marconi.

Run twice against two server configs (Marconi ON vs OFF), identical seeds /
greedy, and diff the per-turn token streams. At batch=1 MTP is active, so this
is the exact documented path: --enable-prefix-caching + --speculative on a
hybrid SSM model, warm Marconi restores across turns. Marconi-OFF (full SSM
recompute each turn) is the proven-correct reference. Greedy ⇒ identical.

Outputs JSON {case: [turn_tokens,...]} to the path in argv[1] so a second run
can diff. Includes tool-call turns (duplicated-tool-arg-fragment symptom).
