"""Multi-turn WARM-vs-COLD greedy diff — exercises decode-era Marconi snapshots.

The shipped warning is about WARM restores of SSM state that was checkpointed
DURING DECODE (decode_marconi_checkpoint, every 64 tokens), then restored when
the next turn's prefix covers those generated tokens. That is the agentic
multi-turn pattern: turn N's (prompt+response) becomes turn N+1's cached prefix.

Protocol per case (prefix-caching ON, MTP forced ON):
  1. COLD reference: build the full turn-2 prompt = T1_prompt + T1_response +
     T2_suffix and send it with a UNIQUE salt prefix so the radix lookup
     misses entirely → pure recompute (the proven-correct cache-off path).
  2. WARM: send T1_prompt (generates T1_response, saving decode-era Marconi
     snapshots), then send T1_prompt + T1_response + T2_suffix. The lookup now
     HITS deep into the generated region and Marconi restores a decode-era
     intermediate SSM snapshot mid-sequence, then suffix-prefills T2_suffix.
  3. Greedy: WARM continuation MUST equal COLD continuation. First divergence
     localizes corruption.

To maximize the chance of an INTERMEDIATE (non-leaf, block-straddling) snapshot
restore, T1 generates a long response (many 64-token checkpoint boundaries) and
T2 shares a deep prefix.
