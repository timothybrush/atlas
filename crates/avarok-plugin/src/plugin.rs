//! A plugin's first step is [`Plugin::load`], which receives a [`PluginHandle`]:
//! the controlled seam onto the host terminal (status line, log, progress, the
//! run-glow) plus the artifact store and the endpoint it is pointed at. The
//! plugin never touches the TUI's state directly — it emits [`PluginEvent`]s
//! that the render thread drains on its own tick, so nothing a plugin does can
//! block or race the redraw.
