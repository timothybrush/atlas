//! Validate a harvested ledger artifact and merge it into the journey ledger.

//! ```text
//! ledger_harvest --root . --pr 433 --from downloaded/pr-433.jsonl
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a harvester exists at all
//!
//! The classify job appends a `Category` line and cannot persist it: it holds
//! `permissions: contents: read`, deliberately, because it consumes model
//! output derived from an attacker-authored PR title. Its own header promises
//! "a compromised model response has nowhere to go even in principle" — and
//! that promise *is* the missing write scope. Granting it `contents: write`
//! would delete the promise to fix the symptom.
//!
//! So the line leaves as a workflow artifact (no write scope needed, works from
//! forks) and a scheduled job running **default-branch code** harvests it. This
//! binary is the validating half of that job.
//!
//! # The trust boundary, stated exactly
//!
//! Artifact content is UNTRUSTED. It was produced by a job running the PR
//! author's workflow file, on the PR author's branch.
//!
//! ★ **`--pr` is supplied by the caller from the run's own API record, and any
//! event disagreeing with it is REJECTED.** This is the single load-bearing
//! check. Without it, PR #1 could upload an artifact claiming to be PR #2 and
//! write into another PR's journey — the artifact naming itself is not
//! evidence of anything.
//!
//! Everything else follows from "escalation is monotone-stricter": a forged
//! `Category` line for one's OWN pr can only make that PR owe MORE gates, never
//! fewer, because `benches_for` unions along a path and the required set is
//! `path_derived ∪ intent_derived`. The worst outcome is a self-inflicted GPU
//! bill.
//!
//! Also enforced, because "monotone-stricter" is only true of well-formed
//! input:
//!
//! * every line must parse as an [`Event`] — malformed input is rejected
//!   wholesale rather than skipped, so a truncated upload cannot silently
//!   contribute a prefix;
//! * only [`EventKind::Category`] is accepted here. `Gate` and `Measurement`
//!   are produced where those things happen (on a GPU box, committed beside the
//!   `.benchmarks/` record), and accepting them from an artifact would let a PR
//!   author assert its own gate verdicts;
//! * the category value must resolve in the taxonomy, or it is dropped with a
//!   warning. A path naming a segment nobody has ever defined is not an
//!   opinion, it is noise — and `pr_taxonomy::validate` already pins that every
//!   `_benches` id is a registered benchmark, so a resolvable path can only
//!   name real gates.
//!
//! Dedup is by [`Event::identity`], which excludes `at` — so re-harvesting the
//! same artifact converges instead of accumulating.
