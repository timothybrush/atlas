//! # Why this exists: there were TWO taxonomy walks, and they disagreed
//!
//! `ci.yml` walked `.github/pr-taxonomy.json` in jq to render the summary
//! table, duplicating [`avarok_plugin::gate::pr_taxonomy::benches_for`]. Run
//! against the same inputs they diverge on four shapes:
//!
//! ```text
//!   performance//decode        jq {agentic-webserver}   Rust 3 benches
//!   " performance / decode "   jq {}                    Rust 3 benches
//!   performance/_benches       jq exit 5                Rust {agentic-webserver}
//!   _doc                       jq exit 5                Rust {}
//! ```
//!
//! Three of those are jq REMOVING benchmarks the Rust requires — the same
//! removing-direction failure that `pr_taxonomy`'s strict `_benches` parser was
//! hardened against, one file over. jq also happily read a bare-string
//! `_benches` that `load` hard-rejects, so a taxonomy typo made the PR summary
//! advertise benchmarks the gate would refuse to load at all.
//!
//! ★ And the error rendering was worse than "(none)": the step runs under
//! `set -euo pipefail`, so a jq exit-5 inside `IMPLIED=$(…)` aborted the step
//! mid-table with stderr discarded. There was no failure rendering.
//!
//! # The contract, and why the three outcomes are separated
//!
//! | stream | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | stdout | one bench id per line, sorted; EMPTY means "implies nothing" |
//! | stderr | a stale-segment warning (exit 0), or the cause (exit != 0) |
//! | exit 0 | an answer was computed, possibly empty |
//! | exit 1 | no answer: unreadable/malformed taxonomy, or bad invocation |
//!
//! "Implies nothing" and "could not tell" must never render alike. That
//! collapse is what let a broken walk read as a clean one.
//!
//! A STALE SEGMENT WARNS RATHER THAN FAILS, deliberately. `benches_for`'s
//! contract is that a renamed category degrades to *fewer extra* benches and
//! never crashes, because it feeds a gate. This binary must not be stricter
//! than the gate it fronts, or the summary and the gate would disagree about
//! the same ledger line — which is the disease being cured.
