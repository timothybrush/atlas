//! Append one event to a PR's journey ledger.
//!
//! `crates/avarok-governance` shipped with a full event model, a grow-only
//! `Journey`, deduplication, and 16 tests — and **zero writers**. Nothing had
//! ever appended a line. This is the first one.
//!
//! ```text
//! ledger_append category --root . --pr 433 --head-sha abc123 \
//!               --run-id 42 --attempt 1 --at 1786280000 \
//!               --value performance/decode --status ok
//! ```
//!
//! Writes `governance/pr-<n>.jsonl` under the repo root. The workflow commits
//! it; this binary does not touch git, for the same reason `pr_telemetry` does
//! not talk to GitHub — the part that decides something stays testable, and
//! the part that has credentials stays trivially reviewable.
//!
//! ★ WHY A CATEGORY EVENT IS WORTH STORING AT ALL. `EventKind::Category`'s own
//! doc says it is "recorded, never acted upon … so the observe-only rollout
//! has something to audit". Today that matters concretely: three live runs on
//! one PR produced `tooling`, `performance`, `tooling` from the flat
//! classifier while the descending one held `infrastructure/*` throughout.
//! Neither observation would exist if the disagreements had not been written
//! down.
