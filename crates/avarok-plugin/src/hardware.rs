//! Hardware fingerprint — what box a benchmark number was measured on.
//!
//! Results committed from different boxes are not comparable without it: a
//! TTFT median from a cold GB10 at idle clocks and the same model on a warm
//! desktop card differ for reasons the model never sees. Every gate record
//! carries one, fetched from the serving endpoint's `/hardware` so it always
//! describes the box that did the work, even when the benchmark CLI runs
//! somewhere else.
//!
//! Field names are deliberately vendor-neutral — the "sm-clock" reading is
//! nvidia-smi's `clocks.sm` on NVIDIA and the equivalent core-clock reading
//! anywhere else.

//! # Two layers
//!
//! * [`Hardware`] — WHICH box, as a fingerprint. Stable across a run, fetched
//!   from the serving endpoint, and the key a gate baseline is indexed by.
//! * [`state::HardwareState`] — WHAT STATE that box was in, captured before
//!   and after every benchmark. Added 2026-08-15, after two boxes with
//!   byte-identical [`Hardware`] fingerprints produced 692 s and 1079 s on the
//!   same gate and a "+38% regression" had to be retracted. See
//!   [`state`] for the incident and [`policy`] for what is gated on it.
