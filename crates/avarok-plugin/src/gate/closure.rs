//! Rung 0: excuse a kernel-only diff when the affected targets compile to the
//! same device code.
//!
//! The path boundary in [`super::coverage`] is the floor and stays exactly as
//! it was — every `kernels/` path still invalidates every gate. This module
//! sits on top and can only ever *narrow* that, never widen it, and only for
//! paths inside `kernels/`.
//!
//! # What "the same" means here
//!
//! A record stores, per target, the closure hash of its sources together with
//! the non-source inputs it was computed under (arch, compiler, nvcc flags).
//! The check recomputes using **the record's own** stored inputs, so the only
//! thing that can move the hash is a change to the sources themselves. That is
//! deliberate and is the exact question rung 0 asks: *did the code change?*
//!
//! Whether the record was measured on a binary built from those sources at all
//! is a different question, answered by the two-sided check at record-write
//! time — not here. Conflating the two would make this check silently depend on
//! the toolchain of whatever machine runs CI.
//!
//! # Fail-closed
//!
//! Every uncertainty resolves to "not excused":
//!
//! - a record written before this existed carries no attestation;
//! - a target the record does not mention;
//! - sources that will not resolve ([`super::taxon::sources`] returning `None`);
//! - an unresolvable `#include`, or any I/O error;
//! - an empty affected set for a non-empty path list.
//!
//! The cost of a false "not excused" is a re-run. The cost of a false "excused"
//! is a shipped regression with a green gate, so the asymmetry is the design.
