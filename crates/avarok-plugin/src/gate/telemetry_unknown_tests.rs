//! A PR whose changed files could not be read must never render as a PR that
//! changes nothing.
//!
//! The collector calls `pulls/N/files` once per PR. That call can fail — a
//! 404 on a PR that vanished mid-run, a 502, a token that lost a scope — and
//! it used to fall through to `changed_paths: []` with no warning. Everything
//! downstream reads an empty list as a measurement: zero targets, zero owners,
//! zero promotion debt, zero collisions, and first place in the merge order
//! (fewest partners, fewest targets, smallest diff). An API error therefore
//! published the single most reassuring record this view can produce, and did
//! it into a comment on the tracking issue.
//!
//! These tests pin the opposite: unknown is maximal, and every row it produces
//! says it is assumed.
