//! What makes one `spark serve` "the same server" as another: the bytes of
//! the binary and the arguments it was started with.
//!
//! A benchmark that reuses a server somebody else started has to know it is
//! measuring what it would have started itself — the same build, the same
//! recipe rendering, the same overrides, the same ENGINE ENVIRONMENT — or its
//! record names a config it never ran. The server publishes them as digests
//! (`GET /serve-config`), never as the arguments themselves: an argv can carry
//! `--auth-token`. The digests are what both sides compute, one spelling, here.
//!
//! ## Why the environment is part of the identity (owner, 2026-09-22)
//!
//! "If the server config has to change to be accurate, we should NOT reuse the
//! server." The recipe half of that was already enforced — a recipe renders to
//! flags, so a different recipe is a different `argv_sha256`. The environment
//! half was NOT: `AVAROK_PREFILL_CODISPATCH=1` and `=0` produce byte-identical
//! argv, so a leased server carrying the wrong lever passed the reuse check and
//! the run measured a config it did not declare. That lever is worth +4.78% on
//! warm TTFT, about 107x the control spread, so this is not a hypothetical.
//!
//! The digest is `serve_env::fingerprint` over `serve_env::process_levers()`:
//! EVERY `AVAROK_*` variable except the closed `serve_env::HARNESS_VARS` list
//! of placement, logging and build variables, so a read the server grows
//! tomorrow is covered by default. `gate::record_env::PERF_CONTROLS` would
//! have been the tempting SSOT, but it holds only the three codispatch keys —
//! fingerprinting it would silently miss `AVAROK_FP8_ROWWISE`,
//! `AVAROK_MTP_DCUT_RATIO` and `AVAROK_MTP_K_LADDER`, which the published
//! recipe also sets, and a safety check that misses three of four levers is
//! worse than none because it gets trusted. The failure directions are not
//! symmetric: refusing a reusable server costs one server start, while
//! reusing a wrong one silently corrupts a record, so this errs toward
//! refusing. Since #1242 the harness computes the expected digest from the
//! lever set the RECIPE declares (`serve_env::reconcile` makes the child's
//! environment exactly that set), not from its own environment.
