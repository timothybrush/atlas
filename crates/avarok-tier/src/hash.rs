//! Stable hash primitives for **durable, cross-process cache keys**.
//!
//! These values are written into the paging peer's NVMe swap file, which
//! outlives the client that wrote them. So the same input must produce the same
//! `u64` forever — across toolchains, platforms, target architectures and
//! rebuilds. That is a *durable on-disk contract*, not a hashmap.
//!
//! `std::hash::DefaultHasher` is unusable here: std documents its algorithm as
//! unspecified and "not to be relied upon over releases", so a toolchain bump
//! silently rotates every persisted key (total cache miss) or collides with a
//! stale namespace (silent wrong-state corruption). `ahash` is worse still — it
//! varies by CPU feature (AES-NI). A crate dependency is also a hazard: a
//! version bump could rotate the fleet's keys. Hence: vendored, ~20 lines, here.
//!
//! They live in `avarok-tier` because it is pure (`anyhow` + `libc`, no CUDA, no
//! verbs) and a common ancestor of its consumers — the SSM tier fingerprint and
//! the KV paging namespace — so both derive keys from ONE definition of these
//! constants rather than separate copies free to drift.
//!
//! ## Threat model (read before reusing these)
//!
//! FNV-1a is **not collision-resistant against an adversary**: it is
//! multiplicative and trivially invertible, so collisions are *constructible*,
//! not merely improbable. That is fine for the current use — a trusted fleet
//! whose model configs are not attacker-chosen, where safety comes from the
//! *injective encoding* of the input plus determinism, and where the birthday
//! bound over a few dozen configs is nil.
//!
//! It would **not** be fine if a shared paging peer ever served untrusted or
//! multi-tenant configs: an attacker able to choose a config could craft one
//! whose namespace collides with another tenant's and read that tenant's
//! recurrent state off the shared peer — defeating the exact property the
//! namespace exists to provide. If that day comes, switch to a keyed hash
//! (keyed BLAKE3, or a vendored SipHash-2-4 with a fixed key) behind a
//! namespace-version bump, which is a deliberate fleet-wide cache flush.
