//! The 5..=32-row native-FP8 dense-FFN decode tier on TENSOR CORES —
//! `w8a16_gemm_m16`, behind `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC` (#927).
//!
//! WHY. Measured on 1xH100, 2026-09-11, Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8, tip
//! `2962cfed7`: at a decode batch of 16 the step is **86.7 ms**, of which the
//! 48 SSM layers are 63.3 ms and the dense FFN inside them is **63%**
//! (~833 us/layer). The tier that serves those widths today,
//! `w8a16_gemv_batch16` (rungs 2-3 of `dense_ffn_batch16_decode.rs`), is
//! bit-exact but **FP32-FMA-bound** at M=16, not bandwidth-bound:
//!
//! | shape | batch16 GEMV @ M=16 | HBM3 |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | gate/up N=17408 K=5120 | 0.260 ms / **342 GB/s** | ~3,000 GB/s |
//! | down    N=5120 K=17408 | 0.330 ms / **270 GB/s** | ~3,000 GB/s |
//!
//! An 89 MB FP8 weight matrix should stream in ~30 us. The GEMV spends ~37 ALU
//! ops per weight BYTE (16 scalar FFMA across the 16 rows, 16 BF16->FP32
//! converts, a LUT lookup, a scale multiply), which caps it near 350 GB/s no
//! matter how fast the DRAM is. `w8a16_gemm_m16` replaces those 16 FFMA with
//! one `mma.sync.m16n8k16` lane-slot — the M tile IS 16 rows, so nothing is
//! padded, which is the whole difference from the tile GEMMs that pad M to 128
//! and waste 7/8 of every tile — and cuts the dequant to ~2 instructions per
//! byte. Target: >= 1,500 GB/s at M=16, >= 1,000 GB/s at M=8.
//!
//! 🔴 NUMERICS — THIS ARM REASSOCIATES; THE BATCH16 ARM DOES NOT.
//! `w8a16_gemv_batch16` reduces each output in ONE FP32 accumulator walked in
//! strict K order, which makes it bit-identical to the scalar `w8a16_gemv` that
//! M=1 decode runs. An MMA reduces 16 K-products in the tensor core's own order
//! first, so THIS arm is not. Its contract is <= 2 BF16 ULP per element, with
//! the 128-K block scale still folded once per block onto an FP32 outer
//! accumulator (the two-level fold, preserved exactly). That is a seam, and it
//! is why the lever exists and defaults OFF.
//!
//! It is not a NEW seam, though: the arm the FFN reached at these widths BEFORE
//! #927 was `w8a16_gemm_n128_m128` / `w8a16_gemm_pipelined`, both m16n8k16 MMA
//! kernels with exactly this reassociation. Turning the lever on returns 5..=32
//! to MMA numerics while keeping the ONE-weight-pass property #927 bought.
//!
//! ARM ORDER in `w8_gemm!` (`dense_ffn.rs`) with the lever ON:
//!   1. `m <= 4`     -> `w8a16_gemv_batch4`                (bit-exact)
//!   2. `m` 5..=16   -> `w8a16_gemm_m16`                   (here, MMA)
//!   3. `m` 17..=32  -> `w8a16_gemm_m16` x2 halves         (here, MMA)
//!   4. `m` 5..=16   -> `w8a16_gemv_batch16`               (bit-exact)
//!   5. `m` 17..=32  -> `w8a16_gemv_batch16` x2 halves     (bit-exact)
//!   6. W8A8 block-scaled prefill (#917/#928)
//!   7. transposed / pipelined / base W8A16 tile GEMMs
//! With the lever OFF (the default) rungs 2-3 vanish and the ladder is exactly
//! what #927 shipped.
//!
//! 17..=32 runs the kernel TWICE on contiguous row halves, for the same reason
//! `batch16_decode.rs` does: the FFN activations and outputs are contiguous
//! `[m, k]` / `[m, n]`, so a half is a plain byte offset, and two weight passes
//! still beat one M-padded MMA tile at these widths.
//!
//! ── THE LEVER IS SPLIT PER PROJECTION FAMILY (round 6) ─────────────────────
//! Round 6's serving A/B on 1xH100 (2026-09-11, bs16, `ATLAS_MS_PROFILE`) with
//! the single old lever turned the WHOLE route on at once and measured two
//! opposite results in one number:
//!
//! | phase | tier | Δ step time |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | attention | QKV + o_proj (`w8a16_gemm_m16{,_strided}`) | **−21.7%** |
//! | SSM layers | dense FFN arm (`w8a16_gemm_m16`) | **+13.7%** |
//! | net | | **+5.2%** |
//!
//! One lever could only ship both or neither, so the win was unbuyable. The
//! grammar is now three presence-based variables, all default OFF:
//!
//! | variable | turns on |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ATLAS_ATTN_M16_TC` | the QKV and o_proj tiers |
//! | `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC` | the dense-FFN arm (rungs 2-3 above) |
//! | `ATLAS_M16_TC` | BOTH — the umbrella, i.e. round 6's behaviour |
//!
//! ⚠ `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC=1` MEANS SOMETHING NARROWER THAN IT DID IN ROUND 6.
//! Before this commit it was the only lever and it reached all three tiers;
//! round 6's serve J and its +5.2% were measured with it. The recipe that
//! reproduces round 6 is now `ATLAS_M16_TC=1`. The recipe that buys the
//! attention win WITHOUT the FFN loss — the point of the split — is
//! `ATLAS_ATTN_M16_TC=1` alone.
//!
//! ── WHY THE FFN ARM LOSES WHERE THE ATTENTION TIERS WIN (HYPOTHESIS) ───────
//! Same kernel, same M, same weight format; the one thing that differs is N,
//! and therefore the grid:
//!
//! | tier | N | CTAs at `N_TILE=32` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | o_proj | 5120 | 160 |
//! | QKV (K, V) | 1024 | 32 |
//! | QKV (Q) | 6144 | 192 |
//! | **dense FFN gate/up** | **17408** | **544** |
//! | dense FFN down | 5120 | 160 |
//!
//! The kernel is 4 warps at 19,456 B of smem under `__launch_bounds__(128, 4)`,
//! so an H100 SM holds 4 CTAs and the machine holds 132 × 4 = **528**. Every
//! attention tier fits inside one partial wave and runs at full occupancy from
//! the first instruction. gate/up at 544 is **one full wave plus a 16-CTA
//! tail**: 3% of the work costs a second wave's worth of launch, prologue and
//! HBM-latency ramp, none of which is overlapped with anything, because by then
//! 116 SMs are idle. That is the leading explanation for a tier that beats
//! `w8a16_gemv_batch16` 3.71× in the microtest (which times ONE shape in
//! isolation, with no tail to pay) and still loses 13.7% in the serve.
//!
//! A second, non-exclusive explanation: at `N_TILE=32` each 16-row A tile is
//! read by twice as many CTAs as at 64, and gate/up's 89 MB weight evicts A
//! from a 50 MB L2 between passes, so the "A stays L2-resident" claim in the
//! kernel header — which holds comfortably at N=1024 — may not hold at
//! N=17408.
//!
//! Both hypotheses predict the same fix, which is why `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC_NTILE`
//! exists: `=64` selects `w8a16_gemm_m16_n64`, taking gate/up to 272 CTAs
//! (inside one wave) and doubling A reuse. Default stays 32 — the tile with the
//! receipt. NEITHER hypothesis has been measured; the A/B that settles it is
//! `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC=1 ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC_NTILE=64` against
//! `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC=1` on the same serve.
//!
//! ── THE ROUND-6 M=32 RED CELL WAS THE ORACLE, NOT THE SPLIT ────────────────
//! Round 6's microtest reported `gate/up M=32` at `max_ulp 28`, 5 of 557,056
//! elements over the 2-ULP budget, `sign_flips 0`, `rel_rms 4.2e-5`, while
//! `down M=32` and every M ≤ 16 cell was green. It was read as a possible
//! row/pitch defect in the two-halves rung. It is not: a host simulation of the
//! exact geometry (`dense_ffn_m16_tc_m32_tests.rs`) reproduces the signature —
//! 5 over-budget elements, none in rows 0..15 — with NO offset arithmetic at
//! all. Every one of them is an output that cancelled to |ref| between 5.7e-6
//! and 1.6e-4 against a reference RMS of 39.1, i.e. to ~1e-7..4e-6 of the
//! matrix scale, where one FP32 accumulation rounding spans hundreds of ordinal
//! BF16 ULP. M=32 trips it and M=16 does not because M=32 samples twice the
//! outputs; gate/up trips it and down does not because gate/up has 3.4× the
//! columns. The fix is in the oracle's comparison (a mixed absolute/relative
//! criterion), not here — see `examples/native_fp8_ffn_m16_tc_microtest.rs`.
