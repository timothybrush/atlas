//! W8A8 block-scaled dense-FFN PREFILL — the gate/up/down GEMM arm that the
//! native-FP8 dispatch in `dense_ffn.rs` reaches ahead of its W8A16 branches.
//!
//! # Reachability — read this before measuring anything here
//!
//! This whole module is **opt-in and unreached by default**. It runs only when
//! the dense FFN holds block-scaled FP8 weights, and
//! `qwen35_dense.rs::load_layers` installs those only when
//!
//! ```text
//! dense_fp8_enabled() && tp_world_size == 1
//!     && variant == Nvfp4Variant::Fp8Dequanted
//!     && proj_is_native_fp8(gate_proj)
//! ```
//!
//! and `dense_fp8_enabled()` is `ATLAS_DENSE_FP8 == "1"`. `git grep
//! ATLAS_DENSE_FP8` returns ONE hit — its own reader. No CI job, no
//! `BENCH.toml` entry and no gate sets it, so no certification record on any
//! branch has ever exercised this code. Without it `self.fp8_weights` is
//! `None`, `forward_prefill_inner` never reaches the selection below, and
//! NEITHER of the two route log lines is emitted. Three served A/B attempts
//! were spent discovering that, each reading as "the lever did not arm".
//!
//! It is off by default because on GB10 native dense FP8 LOSES to the NVFP4
//! autoquant fallback, and not narrowly. Same box, same binary, same
//! byte-identical 949-token prompt, `Qwen3.6-27B-FP8`, TTFT median of 5
//! (spark-256a, 2026-09-11):
//!
//! ```text
//! default (NVFP4)                       1437.2 ms   1.00x
//! ATLAS_DENSE_FP8=1, W8A16 (capped)     2555.8 ms   1.78x slower
//! ATLAS_DENSE_FP8=1, W8A8  (no cap)     3343.3 ms   2.33x slower
//! ```
//!
//! So the ceiling below is worth 23.4% *within* the dense-FP8 path, and the
//! dense-FP8 path is still the slower choice on this arch. GB10's FP8 W8A16
//! kernels are simply less tuned than its NVFP4 W4A16 ones (unfused
//! per-projection GEMV, non-transposed prefill GEMM); closing that is kernel
//! work, not loader wiring. On H100 the trade is the other way round, which is
//! why the ceiling is per-arch data in `kernels/<hw>/HARDWARE.toml` and not a
//! constant here.
//!
//! WHY (#917 / #928). On a native-FP8 checkpoint the dense FFN's prefill GEMMs
//! ran `w8a16_gemm_pipelined`: BF16 activations against E4M3 weights, so the
//! MMA is the BF16 tensor-core path and the FP8 bytes are pure memory savings.
//! Measured on H100 (2026-09-11, 1193-token prompt): TTFT 1075 ms against
//! vLLM's 287 ms for the same model and prompt, with the pipelined kernel
//! turning ~12 TFLOP/s on the FFN shapes. The attention Q/K/V/O projections had
//! already moved to the W8A8 block-scaled path (`paged_qkv.rs` /
//! `paged_oproj.rs`), and the MoE shared expert with them
//! (`moe/forward_prefill_fp8.rs`) — the dense FFN was the one large prefill
//! consumer still on W8A16, and on a dense model it is most of the FLOPs.
//!
//! This gives it the same arithmetic vLLM uses: per-token 1x128 FP32
//! activation scales (`per_token_group_quant_fp8`) multiplied against the
//! checkpoint's 128x128 FP32 weight scales in an FP32 epilogue, with the
//! product accumulated by `mma.sync.m16n8k32.e4m3` — native on sm_90a (H100)
//! and sm_121. Two GEMM implementations sit behind one selector:
//!
//!   * cuBLASLt `fp8_gemm_act_weight_t_blkscaled` (weight as A with
//!     BLK128x128 scales, activation as B with VEC128 scales — the DeepSeek
//!     block-FP8 scheme), when `ATLAS_CUBLAS_GEMM=1`. The Hopper fast path.
//!     Its VEC128 scales go through `fp8_act_scale_to_kmajor` first: cuBLASLt
//!     documents that operand's scales with the TOKEN index contiguous, which
//!     is the transpose of what the quantizer writes (see
//!     `spark_runtime::cublaslt::scale_layout`).
//!   * `ops::fp8_gemm_t_blockscaled`, the in-tree kernel, otherwise.
//!
//! Both consume the SAME quantized activation and the same FP32 epilogue, so
//! they are expected to agree to a BF16 ULP or two; the microtest
//! (`examples/native_fp8_ffn_w8a8_microtest.rs`) pins that.
//!
//! ACCURACY. W8A8 is lossier than W8A16 by construction — the activation is
//! quantized to E4M3 per 128-element group instead of kept in BF16. That is
//! vLLM's dynamic W8A8 arithmetic and a deliberate precision trade, not a bug:
//! the microtest gates it at cosine >= 0.999 / relative RMS <= 2% against the
//! W8A16 reference, and the serve logs the selected path once at INFO so which
//! arithmetic ran is visible in any TTFT report. `ATLAS_FFN_W8A16_ONLY=1`
//! restores the old path byte-for-byte.
