//! Online FP8 KV cache scale calibration.
//!
//! Tracks running max |K| and max |V| during the first
//! `--fp8-kv-calibration-tokens` tokens of inference to compute per-tensor
//! scales: `scale = amax * headroom / 448.0` (mapping the observed dynamic
//! range onto FP8 E4M3 `[-448, 448]`).
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! FP8 KV round-trips (write `fp8 = bf16/scale`, read `bf16 = fp8*scale`) only
//! if the SAME scale quantizes and dequantizes an entry. Paged / multi-query
//! attention reads a sequence's whole history in one pass with ONE
//! `k_scale`/`v_scale`, so a scale that changes under live cache entries
//! dequantizes them through the wrong basis (~6x error → generation garbage:
//! loops, empty completions). That is why the 2026-07-25 hardening froze the
//! scale on the FIRST observe.
//!
//! # Atlas #919
//!
//! Freezing on the first observe made `--fp8-kv-calibration-tokens 256` a lie.
//! Every H100 serve log showed
//! `FP8 KV cache with online calibration (checkpoint ships no k/v scales):
//!  freezing per-tensor scales on the first observed tokens.`
//! and the thing being observed was the readiness probe — so a 24k-context
//! serve ran on scales derived from ~13 tokens.
//!
//! The window is now real: the amax accumulates ACROSS requests until
//! `window_tokens` have been observed, and the batch that reaches the window
//! freezes on the amax of everything seen, itself included. The invariant is
//! preserved by REWRITING the entries written inside the window — the window's
//! BF16 K/V and slot mappings are staged aside and replayed through the
//! existing `reshape_and_cache_fp8` kernel at the frozen scale (see the
//! private `staging` submodule of this module for the full tradeoff). A
//! readiness probe therefore counts toward the window and can never end it on
//! its own.
//!
//! Thread safety: uses `parking_lot::Mutex` for interior mutability. The lock
//! is uncontended (single inference thread) so lock overhead is negligible.
