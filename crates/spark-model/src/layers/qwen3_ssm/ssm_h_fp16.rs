//! FP16 h-state storage for the GDN decode scan (`ATLAS_SSM_H_FP16`).
//!
//! The decode scan is pure state traffic — it moves 2.0 DRAM passes over h and
//! already runs at 90% of GB10's row-strided ceiling — so its time is set by
//! the state footprint and by nothing else. Storing h as FP16 halves that
//! footprint and halves the time: 183 -> 84 ms/step at n=128, measured on a
//! replica faithful to the in-serve kernel within 2.4%.
//!
//! **Stage 1 keeps the pool FP32-sized.** Prefill still writes FP32 through six
//! kernel families, so the slot must stay large enough for FP32; the FP16 state
//! occupies the first half of the same region. Nothing about allocation,
//! preflight arithmetic, snapshot sizing, spill layout or the tier fingerprint
//! changes, and every byte-wise copier (snapshot save/restore, decode ring,
//! swap file, slot migration) stays correct without knowing the dtype. The one
//! consequence the batched kernel must be told about is that consecutive slots
//! are then `h_state_bytes` apart, i.e. TWICE the dense FP16 footprint — hence
//! its explicit `h_seq_stride` parameter.
//!
//! The invariant is: **a slot holds FP32 while its sequence is prefilling and
//! FP16 while it is decoding**, and `SsmLayerState::h_is_f16` is the single
//! source of truth for which. The flip happens in exactly one place —
//! `TransformerModel::ssm_h_to_f16_dispatch`, at the top of each decode entry
//! point.
//!
//! ★ It CANNOT happen inside the layer. Decode runs under a captured CUDA
//! graph, and a conversion launched from the layer is captured into that graph
//! and then replayed on every subsequent step — re-reading the already-FP16
//! state as FP32. That produced fluent-but-degenerate output (`"Reducing!!!!!!"`)
//! while the host-side flag correctly said "already converted": the host was
//! right, the graph did not care. The layer therefore only ever SELECTS a
//! kernel, and refuses loudly if it is handed an unconverted state.
//!
//! The reverse edge is closed by writing decode-produced Marconi snapshots back
//! as FP32 (`ssm_snapshot::save`), which keeps every snapshot FP32 and leaves
//! the restore path — always into a prefill — untouched.

// ── Stage 3: the f16-SIZED pool ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Stage 1/2 above keep the pool FP32-sized because prefill writes the running
// h-state FP32 IN PLACE through six GDN kernel families. Stage 3
// (`--ssm-h-dtype f16-pool`) halves the pool instead, and pays for it with a
// per-slot FP32 STAGING blob (`SsmStatePool::h_prefill_stage`) that prefill
// runs over:
//
//   widen (f16 slot -> FP32 stage) -> the unchanged FP32 kernels -> narrow
//   (FP32 stage -> f16 slot)
//
// so not one prefill kernel changes and the pool holds FP16 at every moment
// OUTSIDE a layer's prefill call. That last property is the whole invariant:
// `SsmLayerState::h_is_f16` is then simply `true` for a sequence's entire
// life, the decode mixer is a no-op, snapshot save always widens, snapshot
// restore always narrows, and slot zeroing is format-agnostic.
//
// ★ Unlike the decode conversion, this pair is SAFE to launch from inside the
// layer: it is issued once per prefill call and is self-cancelling, so a
// replay would re-widen the current slot rather than re-narrow an already
// narrow one. Prefill is not CUDA-graph captured; if it ever is, this pair
// captures correctly because both halves are inside the captured region.
//
// The cost is 1.5 extra DRAM passes over one layer's h per prefill pass
// (widen reads 2 bytes/elem and writes 4, narrow the reverse): ~3.1 MB per
// layer per pass on the 27B GDN shape, ~150 MB per 48-layer pass — a few
// percent of a chunk's prefill time, against halving the per-step per-
// sequence decode state traffic that dominates concurrency.

/// A prefill pass's h-state pointer, plus what has to happen when it is done.
