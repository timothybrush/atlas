// ── The two HOPPER-ONLY prefill twin probes, one function each ─────────────
//
// `try_kernel` and not `kernel` in both: these modules exist only under
// `kernels/hopper` (declared in that target's `[kernels] overrides`), so on
// gb10/b200/strix the lookup must MISS quietly and leave the launcher on the
// parent kernel. A handle of 0 IS the "not on this target" answer; nothing
// downstream needs a second way to ask.
//
// One named function per handle rather than one helper taking two strings:
// the module/entry pair is the whole content of the probe, and a call site
// that passes them as arguments has simply moved the thing being reviewed
// back into `init.rs`. They live here for the 500-LoC cap, beside
// `gdn_prefill_tc_kernel`, which is the same shape for the third kernel of
// the same prefill family.

/// Prefill kernel 1's twin: the two forward substitutions on tensor cores
/// (#928). Selected by `[defaults] gdn_prefill_tc`, the same family lever as
/// [`gdn_prefill_tc_kernel`] above; unlike the spine, the probe is NOT gated on
/// it, because `gated_delta_rule_fla`'s parent is always loaded and a twin that
