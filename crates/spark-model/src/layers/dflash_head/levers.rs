//! DFlash drafter levers, resolved once per head and then carried.
//!
//! # ★ THE ENVIRONMENT IS READ EXACTLY ONCE PER HEAD. KEEP IT THAT WAY.
//!
//! `forward_block` runs once per DECODE STEP, and its per-layer helpers run
//! `num_layers` times inside that. Every `std::env::var` on that path
//! allocates a `String` and takes the PROCESS-WIDE environment lock, so
//! concurrent decode threads serialise against each other on it —
//! MEASURED on GB10: a 30-variable resolve costs 0.57 us single-threaded but
//! **4.00 us at 8 threads and 5.76 us at 16**. The cost grows with
//! concurrency, which is exactly why no single-stream benchmark shows it.
//!
//! Before this module `forward_block` read **31** variables per propose, ten
//! of them duplicates of a variable it had already read in the same call, and
//! eleven of them in a single `&&` chain whose only job was to answer one
//! question: is any diagnostic armed?
//!
//! These are resolved at head construction rather than in a `OnceLock`
//! static, for the reason [`crate::layers::ops::ModelLevers`] gives: a static
//! outlives the model whose flags it encodes, so a second model silently
//! keeps the first one's branches. A field on the head cannot go stale,
//! because a new head is a new resolution.

/// Diagnostic and A/B levers for one loaded DFlash drafter.
///
/// Plain `Copy` data. Every field is a pure function of one `ATLAS_*`
/// variable except [`Self::any_diagnostic_armed`], which is a function of
/// eleven of them.
// `Eq` is deliberately absent: `conf_tau` is an f32 threshold. Comparing two
// resolutions for equality is a test-only need and `PartialEq` covers it.
