//! Per-sequence DSA indexer state — the cache the selector reads every decode step.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all
//!
//! The indexer scores each pool from `k_normed` and `gate`, both projections of the
//! *hidden* state (`indexer.wk`, `index_kpool_compress_gate`). Neither is recoverable
//! from the MLA latent — `wk · hidden` cannot be inverted out of a rank-512 compression —
//! so the indexer needs its own cache stream alongside the KV cache. HF does the same
//! thing, keeping indexer state on a per-layer `DynamicIndexedLayer` via
//! `past_key_values.update_indexer`.
//!
//! # No new subsystem
//!
//! `TransformerLayer::alloc_state` is called once per sequence and `LayerState` is an
//! `Any` downcast hook — the same mechanism `qwen3_ssm` uses for recurrent state. This is
//! that, with a bigger buffer.
//!
//! # 🪤 Flat, not paged
//!
//! `dsa_kpool_compress` and `dsa_index_scores` index `k[raw * D + d]` **linearly**, and
//! pools are built over absolute positions from the first valid token. So this is one
//! contiguous per-sequence buffer, not block-table paged. The MLA latent stays paged; only
//! the indexer stream is flat.
