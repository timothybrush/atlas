//! # 🪤 Four silent-wrong-answer traps this file exists to hold
//!
//! * **Two RMSNorm kernels differ only by a `+1`.** `rms_norm` computes
//!   `x * rms * (1 + w)`; `rms_norm_vanilla` computes `x * rms * w`. Same signature, same
//!   shapes. GLM is plain, so every norm here takes the *vanilla* entry point.
//! * **`indexer.k_norm` is an `nn.LayerNorm` with a bias**, not an RMSNorm at all — mean
//!   subtraction plus a bias term. It takes `nllb_layernorm_bf16(x, w, b, …)`.
//! * **`weights_proj` output must already carry `index_heads^-0.5`.** `dsa_index_scores`
//!   does not apply it. Folded into the weight at load — see [`Glm5NextDsaWeights`].
//! * **Q must be absorbed into latent space before it reaches the decode kernel.** The
//!   kernel dots Q against the 512-dim latent directly, so `q_absorb` is `q_b_proj`
//!   pre-multiplied by `kv_b_proj`'s K half. A raw `q_b_proj` is the right shape per head
//!   (256 vs 512 is not) but the wrong space.

/// `-FLT_MAX`, and `dsa_topk_pools` excludes it under a TOTAL order (score DESC, then pool
/// index ASC — unique, so the top-`select_k` prefix is unique).
///
/// 🔴 Equal membership was NOT equal placement, and that distinction cost a review cycle.
/// `dsa_expand_selection` writes the visible tail at `select_k * KP`, and `select_k` is a
/// per-pass scalar: the original batched geometry planned it once from the group's FINAL
/// cache length, so every earlier row's tail slid forward relative to its serial twin. The
/// production attention (`glm5next_dsa_mla_decode_fp8`) splits the selection row into
/// `NUM_WARPS = 8` slices, runs a per-warp online softmax and merges across warps, so a
/// slid token is folded by the MERGE instead of by its warp's serial loop. **The original
/// batched geometry was shown to ALTER warp FP reduction grouping** — measured on the real
/// kernel, 14 of 18 crossing configurations differ by up to 2 BF16 ulp over 64 draws each
/// (a single draw is byte-identical, which is why one probe proved nothing: the kernel
/// accumulates in FP32 and writes BF16). Over a 9,000-token prefill at `PREFILL_ROWS = 16`,
/// 1,920 of 8,999 rows moved their tail base and 42 moved a real token across a warp slice.
///
/// The correction is per-row geometry inside `dsa_expand_selection`:
/// `row_select_k = min(select_k, (q_pos[r] + 1) / KP)`, applied to both the pool loop and
/// the tail base. It **preserves serial selection-slot geometry** and is a no-op at
/// `q_rows == 1`, so the serial and replay-safe paths are untouched. Exact selector parity
/// was restored: real-kernel serial-vs-batched comparison over 2,397 rows went from 1,533
/// mismatching rows to **0**.
///
/// Measured on the 9K prefill probe, n3+n4, fresh container, first request after launch:
/// **146.073 s -> 134.001 s, -12.072 s / -8.26 %**, with the canonical six reproducing the

/// (2026-09-06, `scripts/glm53-dsa-promote/{gate-6probe.sh,ADJUDICATION.md}`).
///
/// The four `[max_rows]` twins are allocated only when this is on, so the kill-switch arm
