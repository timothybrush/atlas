//! GLM-5.3-Flash **MLP production surface** — dense FFN and routed MoE.
//!
//! Scoped to `LibertAIDAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4@9e0d74e3`.
//!
//! Same shape as [`crate::layers::glm5next_dsa`]: the CUDA kernels already exist and are
//! numerically proven against HF 5.16.1 on real weights — `kernels/gb10/common/glm5next_ffn.cu`
//! (clamped SwiGLU, sigmoid router top-k, routed/shared combine), gated by
//! `examples/glm5next_{ffn,moe}_microtest.rs`. What was missing, and what this module adds, is
//! the production surface: config, kernel resolution, a weight contract and a forward a real
//! layer can call, rather than an example wiring pointers by hand.
//!
//! # The stack this layer runs
//!
//! ```text
//! DENSE (layers 0..first_k_dense_replace)   x -> gate_proj/up_proj -> clamped SwiGLU -> down_proj
//!
//! ROUTED (every later layer)
//!   x ─┬─ gate.weight ──── logits(f32) ─ router_topk ─ ids[K], weights[K]
//!      ├─ experts[id]  ─── NVFP4 gate/up -> clamped SwiGLU -> NVFP4 down  (LOCAL ids only)
//!      └─ shared_experts ─ BF16 gate/up  -> clamped SwiGLU -> BF16 down
//!                                       └─> moe_combine -> partial -> all_reduce
//! ```
//!
//! # 🔴 Why one all-reduce covers BOTH EP and TP
//!
//! The campaign's topology is `world = 2, TP = 2, EP = 2` on the *same* two ranks. The routed
//! experts are EP-sharded (144/rank, remote ids contribute zero) and the dense/shared FFN is
//! TP-sharded (column-parallel gate/up, row-parallel down). Both leave a **partial sum** of the
//! same `[T, hidden]` output, and `all_reduce(SUM)` is linear, so the two partials are summed by
//! one collective at the end of the site. Reducing them separately would be two collectives for
//! the same answer.
//!
//! 🪤 That is only true because the combine happens BEFORE the reduce. Adding the shared expert
//! after an all-reduce of the routed partial — which is what `layers::moe::forward` does, for a
//! model whose shared expert is replicated rather than TP-sharded — would add a TP-partial
//! shared output exactly once and lose the other rank's half.
//!
//! # 🪤 Traps this module exists to hold
//!
//! * **The SwiGLU clamp is ASYMMETRIC**: `gate` is upper-bounded only, `up` is bounded both
//!   ways. It is also invisible on well-scaled activations — it fires on the tails. The limit
//!   comes from `ModelConfig::swiglu_limit`, which the `glm5_next` parser refuses to default.
//! * **The router's correction bias steers SELECTION ONLY.** The emitted weight is the
//!   *unbiased* sigmoid score of the chosen expert. Gathering the biased score still produces a
//!   plausible mixture.
//! * **`routed_scaling_factor` rides on the top-k weights and the shared expert is NOT scaled by
//!   it** (`apply_routed_scale_to_output = false`). Scaling the shared output is the same defect
//!   with the opposite sign.
//! * **The router is REPLICATED and must stay bit-identical across ranks.** Masked-local EP is
//!   only equivalent to dispatch when every rank agrees on the same `ids`. Sharding the gate
//!   would give each rank partial logits and a different top-k — no crash, different experts.
//! * **`num_experts` here is the FULL count (288).** The rank's local range is a separate field.
//!   Passing the local count to `glm5next_router_topk` would rank 144 experts and renormalise
//!   over the wrong denominator.
