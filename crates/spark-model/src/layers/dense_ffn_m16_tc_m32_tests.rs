//! HOST SIMULATION of the `w8a16_gemm_m16` two-halves rung at round 6's
//! `gate/up M=32` geometry — the test that settles what that red cell was.
//!
//! ROUND 6 (1xH100, 2026-09-11, `native_fp8_ffn_m16_tc_microtest`): eleven of
//! twelve cells green, and `gate/up N=17408 K=5120 M=32` RED — `max_ulp 28`,
//! `over_budget 5` of 557,056 elements, `sign_flips 0`, `rel_rms 4.237e-5`,
//! `max_abs 0.500`. `down M=32` was green, as was every M <= 16 cell. M=32 is
//! the two-halves rung (`first = m.div_ceil(2)` = 16 + 16), so the first
//! suspicion was a row or pitch offset on the second half.
//!
//! IT IS NOT. Two independent things are pinned here, and the second is the
//! one that explains the cell:
//!
//! 1. **The offsets are right.** [`halves_route`] applies exactly the byte
//!    offsets `DenseFfnLayer::w8a16_m16_tc_proj` applies (`first * k` on the
//!    input, `first * n` on the output), and the rows it produces are
//!    BIT-IDENTICAL to evaluating each row on its own. Both a wrong input
//!    offset and a wrong output offset are shown to break that, so the
//!    assertion is not vacuous.
//!
//! 2. **The red cell is the oracle's metric.** A full-geometry host run of the
//!    microtest's own data generator (K=5120, N=17408, M=32, seed
//!    `0x927_16_7C_2026`) reproduces the signature with no offset arithmetic
//!    anywhere: 5 elements over the 2-ULP budget, none of them in rows 0..15,
//!    `sign_flips` 0. Every one is an output that cancelled to |ref| between
//!    5.7e-6 and 1.6e-4 against a reference RMS of 39.1 — 1e-7..4e-6 of the
//!    matrix scale — with absolute errors of 3.8e-6..1.05e-5. M=32 trips it and
//!    M=16 does not because M=32 samples twice as many outputs; gate/up trips it
//!    and down does not because gate/up has 3.4x the columns. The cases below
//!    pin the round-6 numbers through [`within_m16_tc_budget`] in BOTH
//!    directions: the cancelled elements pass, and an error of structural size
//!    does not.
//!
//! The simulation is faithful to the two reduction orders it compares:
//! [`gemv_reference`] is `w8a16_gemv`'s (64 lanes striding by 64 over 16-wide
//! K chunks, then the shfl butterfly and the two-warp add) and [`mma_row`] is
//! `w8a16_gemm_m16`'s (four m16n8k16 sub-steps per 64-K step, two K-steps per
//! 128-wide scale block, the block scale folded ONCE onto an FP32 outer
//! accumulator). The MMA's internal 16-product order is unspecified hardware, so
//! the sequential model here is one plausible realisation — which is the point:
//! the tail does not depend on picking the right one.
//!
//! N is the sampled width, not 17408: what governs the cancellation is the
//! REDUCTION DEPTH, and K is the real 5120 (40 whole 128-wide scale blocks).
//! Running the real N here would be a 2.9-GMAC unit test.
