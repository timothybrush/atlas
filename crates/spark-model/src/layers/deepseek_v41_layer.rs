//! DeepSeek-V4.1 Flash: one transformer block on the generic model.
//!
//! The generic `TransformerModel` owns the embedding, the FP32 mHC highway
//! (`BufferArena::hc_streams`, `[T, hc, H]`), the final norm and the LM head;
//! each layer here does everything in between, in the reference's order
//! (`deepseek_v41_ref::model::forward`, 39/39 against DeepSeek's golden):
//!
//! ```text
//! layer 0 only:        hc_expand(embedding -> streams)
//! engram layers only:  streams += engram(token n-grams)          (EngramV41)
//! attention:           (pre_a, post_a, comb_a) = hc_mixes(streams, attn site)
//!                      x = rmsnorm(collapse(streams, pre_prev))   <- DELAYED pre
//!                      streams = hc_post(attn(x), streams, post_a, comb_a)
//! ffn:                 (pre_f, post_f, comb_f) = hc_mixes(streams, ffn site)
//!                      x = rmsnorm(collapse(streams, pre_a))
//!                      streams = hc_post(moe(x), streams, post_f, comb_f)
//!                      pre_prev = pre_f
//! last layer only:     hidden = collapse(streams, pre_prev)      (no learned head)
//! ```
//!
//! `pre_prev` starts as the one-hot on stream 0 (the reference's initial
//! pre-mix) and travels with the sequence through [`V41Runtime`]. So do the
//! shared attention slots, the engram hasher and the expert cache: V4.1's
//! attention is shared ACROSS layers (four kv sources write, forty read), which
//! no per-layer state can express, so one runtime object is shared by all
//! forty layers through an `Arc` and guarded by mutexes. One sequence at a
//! time; multi-sequence decode and the MODEL-level CUDA graph are declined
//! through the layer hooks. The layer captures its own single-token step
//! instead (`ATLAS_DS41_GRAPH=1`, see [`GraphMode`]): the host work in the
//! middle of every layer (the routing download and the expert fetch; on the
//! twelve kv/index source layers also the compressor group and the index
//! top-k) splits the step into graph segments with the host spans between.
//!
//! Routed experts never sit in HBM: the cache is a page-locked, device-visible
//! arena the GPU reads in place (`ExpertLru` + `ExpertSliceMap`), filled by
//! pread from the seven shards; the engram tables are read by row (`EngramRowReader`).
