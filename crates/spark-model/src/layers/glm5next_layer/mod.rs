//! `Glm5NextLayer` — the composite GLM-5.3 decoder layer that implements `TransformerLayer`.
//!
//! This is the piece that makes the model *bind*. Everything it dispatches to already existed
//! and was numerically gated in Slices 1–13; what did not exist was a single type the loader can
//! return 45 of, dispatching mixer (KDA | DSA) + MLP (dense | routed MoE) + mHC in the order
//! [`crate::layers::glm5next_skeleton`] records as data.
//!
//! # The residual plan, executed
//!
//! Per site, exactly `ResidualStep`'s order:
//!
//! ```text
//! layer 0 only:  hc_expand(hidden) -> streams        [hc_mult, hidden] FP32 highway
//!
//! attention site:  hc_pre(streams) -> y, post, comb
//!                  rms_norm_vanilla(y, input_layernorm) -> normed
//!                  mixer(normed) -> block_out
//!                  hc_post(block_out, residual = streams, post, comb) -> streams
//!
//! FFN site:        the same, with post_attention_layernorm and the MLP
//!
//! last layer:    hc_head_mean(streams) -> hidden     UNWEIGHTED mean, no parameters
//! ```
//!
//! 🪤 **`hc_pre` does not modify `streams`.** That is what makes the skeleton's
//! `ResidualStep::SaveResidual` free here — `hc_post` reads the same buffer as its residual and
//! writes back over it. Snapshotting is only needed if something overwrites the highway between
//! the two calls; nothing here does, and the ordering below is the guard.
//!
//! # 🪤 The traps this file holds
//!
//! * **GLM's norms are PLAIN RMSNorm.** `rms_norm_vanilla` is `x * rms * w`; the other
//!   `rms_norm` is `x * rms * (1 + w)`. Identical signatures, identical shapes, and picking the
//!   wrong one is silent. Every norm here takes the vanilla entry point.
//! * **The mHC head collapse is an UNWEIGHTED MEAN.** GLM's `Glm5NextTextHyperHead` has no
//!   parameters and the checkpoint carries zero `hc_head` tensors, unlike DeepSeek-V4's learned
//!   sigmoid-weighted sum. Reaching for `ops::hc_head` would look for weights that do not exist.
//! * **The highway is indexed by TOKEN.** Prefill is overridden rather than left to the trait's
//!   sequential default, because that default runs every token through layer 0 before layer 1 —
//!   which with a single-slot highway would leave only the LAST token's streams alive. See
//!   `Glm5NextLayer::prefill`.
//! * **Both MLP arms leave a PARTIAL SUM** whenever TP or EP is on. The single `all_reduce` at
//!   the end of the FFN site covers both, and it must happen *before* `hc_post` mixes the output
//!   back into the highway.
