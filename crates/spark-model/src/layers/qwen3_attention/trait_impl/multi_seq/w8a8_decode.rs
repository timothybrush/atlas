//! W8A8 block-scaled cuBLASLt arm for the ATTENTION decode projections at
//! 5..16 concurrent rows — Q/K/V (strided) and O (contiguous).
//!
//! WHY (#927). H100, 2026-09-11 round 7, `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8`, batch 16,
//! steady-state n=16 decode step **43.595 ms** (idle 4.2%), nsys
//! `--cuda-graph-trace=node`. Resolved by grid shape:
//!
//! * `w8a16_gemv_batch16_strided` GrdX 3072 — `q_proj` (N=12288, the
//!   interleaved `[Q|gate]`): 16 launches × 180.8 µs = **2.89 ms**.
//! * `w8a16_gemv_batch16_strided` GrdX 256 — `k_proj` + `v_proj` (N=1024):
//!   32 launches × 26.4 µs = **0.85 ms**.
//! * `w8a16_gemv_batch16` GrdX 1280 — the 16 `o_proj` launches inside the
//!   64-launch group, ~**1.70 ms**.
//!
//! ~5.44 ms, 12.5% of the step, at the same ~350-500 GB/s the SSM projections
//! sit at — while the dense FFN runs the SAME 16 rows through cuBLASLt W8A8 at
//! ~128 µs/layer for 267 MB (~2 100 GB/s-equivalent).
//!
//! ⚠ THE STRIDED OUTPUT IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY. The multi-seq QKV buffer is
//! `[n, per_seq_qkv]` — Q at offset 0 of each sequence's slot, K at
//! `q_proj_bytes`, V after it — so a contiguous `[M, N]` GEMM cannot write it.
//! `fp8_gemm_act_weight_t_blkscaled_ldc` takes the output row pitch, which is
//! exactly what cuBLASLt's D layout already has (`ldc` on a column-major
//! `[N, M]` IS a row-major `[M, N]`'s row pitch), so one extra parameter buys
//! the strided write with no staging buffer and no scatter kernel.
//!
//! ⚠ AND THE PHANTOM ROWS ARE THE TRAP. `cublas_fp8_proj_prequant` hands
//! cuBLASLt `ceil16(M) = 16` for every row count in this band, and those
//! phantom rows ARE written. With a contiguous output they land past the live
//! rows; with THIS one they land in decode slots `n..16` — slots belonging to
//! sequences that are not in this step, whose contents are re-projected before
//! anything reads them. That is correct, but only while the buffer really has
//! 16 slots, so the selector bounds the FULL padded write extent
//! (`(m_pad - 1) * ldc + n` elements, from EACH projection's own base — V's is
//! the tightest) against the arena. A buffer that cannot hold it declines to
//! the `w8a16_gemv_batch16_strided` tier rather than writing past its end.
//!
//! NUMERICS. Same trade the dense FFN already takes at these widths, and
//! vLLM's: dynamic per-token 1×128 E4M3 activation quant instead of BF16
//! activations. M=1 decode is untouched. SSOT: `ops::dispatch_proj_decode`.
