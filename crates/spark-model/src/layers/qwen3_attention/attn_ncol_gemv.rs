//! The N-column-blocked W8A16 decode tier for the ATTENTION projections —
//! `w8a16_gemv_batch16_ncol{2,4}`, behind `ATLAS_ATTN_NCOL_GEMV` (#927).
//!
//! WHY. Measured on 1xH100, 2026-09-11, Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8, serve H
//! (`ATLAS_FFN_NO_BATCH16=1`, graphs off, batch 16): the step is 82.3 ms, of
//! which the 16 attention layers are 18.8 ms = **1177 µs/layer**. The full
//! split is `ATTN-DECODE-ATTRIBUTION.md`; the part this module acts on:
//!
//! | attention-layer sub-phase at n=16 | µs/layer | kernel |
//! |---|---:|---|
//! | dense FFN inside the layer | ~779 | (the FFN ladder's, not ours) |
//! | Q/K/V projections (73.4 MB of weight) | ~215 | `w8a16_gemv_batch16_strided` |
//! | o_proj (31.5 MB) | ~105 | `w8a16_gemv_batch16` |
//! | RoPE + q/k norm + KV write + paged decode + gate + residual | ~78 | already one launch each |
//!
//! So the projections are 27% of the phase and they are NOT bandwidth bound.
//! #927's receipt for the same kernel reads 342 GB/s against ~3,000 GB/s of
//! HBM3, because `w8a16_gemv_batchm_impl<16>` gives each thread ONE output
//! column and therefore pays, per 16 weight bytes, 32 `uint4` activation loads
//! and 256 BF16->FP32 converts on top of the 256 FFMA that are the work —
//! ~36 ALU ops per weight byte. Every other column's thread loads and converts
//! the SAME activations. `N_COLS` adjacent columns per thread amortise both:
//! ~36 -> ~27 ops/byte at N_COLS=2, ~23 at N_COLS=4, floor 18.
//!
//! 🟢 BIT-EXACT, and that is the whole reason this tier exists next to
//! `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC`. The lane -> k16 map, the per-accumulator operand order
//! and the reduction tree are the single-column kernel's, element for element
//! (argument in `kernels/gb10/common/w8a16_gemv_ncol.cu`); the convert is
//! hoisted out of the column loop and a BF16->FP32 widening is exact. So each
//! row stays bit-identical to the scalar `w8a16_gemv` that M=1 decode runs,
//! exactly as `w8a16_gemv_batch{4,16}` are. `w8a16_gemm_m16` buys more and
//! REASSOCIATES (<= 2 BF16 ULP); this one buys less and opens no seam.
//!
//! ⚠ UNMEASURED ON DEVICE, hence OPT-IN. The ops-per-byte arithmetic above is
//! a hypothesis until an H100 receipt exists, and it is bought with registers.
//! `ptxas -v -arch=sm_90a` (CUDA 13.0, `--fmad=false`, same flags as the
//! build), all four entry points, 0 spill bytes:
//!
//! | kernel | registers | smem | blocks/SM at 256 threads |
//! |---|---:|---:|---:|
//! | `w8a16_gemv_batch16` (today) | 64 | 1 KB | 4 (32 warps) |
//! | `..._ncol2[_strided]` | 128 | 2 KB | 2 (16 warps) |
//! | `..._ncol4[_strided]` | 214 | 3 KB | 1 (8 warps) |
//!
//! So the tier trades occupancy for ILP, which is exactly the trade a device
//! measurement has to settle: N_COLS=2 halves the resident warps, N_COLS=4
//! quarters them. That is why 2 is the default width and why nothing flips on
//! its own. The receipt is
//! `examples/native_fp8_attn_decode_batch_microtest`, which asserts
//! bit-identity and times every route at n in {2,4,8,16}.
//!
//! GRAPH-CAPTURE. Both call sites pass the ctx `n`, which IS `padded_n` (the
//! ladder in `traits::model::padded_batch_n`, which the graph cache is keyed
//! by), so branching on it bakes exactly the value the graph is keyed by — the
//! same contract the n==2 / n==3 NVFP4 branches and the FP8 QKV tier rely on.
//! Never branch on the unpadded `seqs.len()`. The lever itself is resolved
//! ONCE into a layer field at construction, so a replay cannot take a
//! different route than the capture did.
//!
//! BAND 5..=16, deliberately the band `w8a16_gemv_batch16` already owns. The
//! ALU wall is proportional to M: at m <= 4 `w8a16_gemv_batch4` pays ~10
//! ops/byte and is already near the bandwidth floor, so widening the band
//! would swap a route that is not the problem for a MAX_M=16 register array.
//! 17+ is above the kernel's MAX_M, which CLAMPS rather than erroring.
