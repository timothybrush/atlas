//! Paged-decode attention SPLIT-K: how many splits, and which pair of kernels
//! runs them (#928).
//!
//! Split out of `run_paged_decode.rs` — which is already on the file-size
//! cap's allow list — because this is one question with one answer and three
//! call sites (the NVFP4 arm, the FP8 arm and the BF16 arm) that used to spell
//! it out twice and refuse it once.
//!
//! # What was wrong
//!
//! ```text
//! use atlas_core::device::sm121::NUM_SMS;            // 48 — the GB10 constant
//! let current_ctas = num_q_heads * split_ref_seqs(num_seqs, max_decode_seqs);
//! let num_splits = if current_ctas >= NUM_SMS { 1 } else { NUM_SMS / current_ctas };
//! ```
//!
//! On an H100 with `--max-batch-size 16` that is `24 * 16 = 384 >= 48` at
//! EVERY batch size, so `num_splits` was always 1 and `paged_decode_attn_fp8`
//! ran `grid=(24,1,1)` — 24 CTAs on 132 SMs, 231.51 us/launch for 9.93 MB of
//! KV = 42.9 GB/s = 1.28% of HBM, 22.7% of a C=1 decode step with its BF16
//! sibling (nsys, round 13 cell T1N; `ATTN-DECODE-SPLITK-ATTRIBUTION.md`).
//!
//! Both halves are fixed in [`atlas_kernels::attn_splitk`]: the SM count is
//! the compiled target's (`[hardware] sm_count`), and the `auto` policy sizes
//! for the SINGLE-STREAM shape, which is the one that starves. The policy is a
//! pure function of configuration, so the non-associative split-merge sees a
//! reduction tree that is FIXED for the life of a serve — the invariant
//! `split_ref_seqs` was added to protect
//! (`tasks/determinism_investigation.md`), preserved rather than relaxed.
