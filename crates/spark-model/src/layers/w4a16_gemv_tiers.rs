//! SSOT for the narrow `w4a16_gemv_batch{M}` tier family (M = 4..8).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! `w4a16_gemv_batchm_impl<MAX_M>` sizes `acc[]`, `s_vl[]` and `smem[]` by
//! `MAX_M`, and because its row loop is `#pragma unroll`ed, `MAX_M` also sizes
//! the CODE: at 80 static SASS instructions per row on sm_121f, the MAX_M=8
//! tier is 760 instructions against MAX_M=4's 440. The `t >= M` guard skips a
//! dead row's WORK at run time but not its instructions, and the template is
//! issue-bound (not DRAM-bound) at these M — so running M=5 on the MAX_M=8
//! tier pays for three rows that are not there.
//!
//! Measured on the real 27B qkv/o shape (N=5120 K=5120, cold-cycled weights,
//! 273 GB/s peak) before the exact-M tiers existed:
//!
//! | tier   | M | time     | eff BW     | % peak |
//! |--------|---|----------|------------|--------|
//! | batch4 | 4 |  70.5 us | 209.2 GB/s | 76.6%  |
//! | batch8 | 4 |  74.8 us | 197.3 GB/s | 72.3%  |
//! | batch8 | 5 |  89.0 us | 165.7 GB/s | 60.7%  |
//! | batch8 | 6 |  91.5 us | 161.2 GB/s | 59.0%  |
//! | batch8 | 8 | 106.4 us | 138.5 GB/s | 50.7%  |
//!
//! The `batch8 @ M=4` row is the argument: same rows, same weight stream,
//! +6.1% for nothing. It is NOT occupancy — batch4 lands on 48 registers /
//! 5 CTA per SM with no `__launch_bounds__` at all, which is exactly what the
//! pragma pins batch8 to.
//!
//! # Why a shared table instead of a `match` per call site
//!
//! Before this module, FIVE structs each carried a `w4a16_gemv_batch4_k` /
//! `w4a16_gemv_batch8_k` pair and each re-derived `1..=4 => batch4,
//! 5..=8 => batch8` inline (dense_ffn, qwen3_ssm x2, qwen3_attention, mtp_head,
//! model). Adding three tiers would have meant five more copies of a widening
//! decision. The decision now lives here once, as a PURE function over which
//! tiers the loaded target actually resolved.
//!
//! # Kill switch
//!
//! `ATLAS_NO_GEMV_EXACT_M_TIERS=1` (presence-checked per the house convention;
//! `=0` is NOT off) hides widths 5/6/7 from the decision, restoring exactly the
//! batch4/batch8 dispatch that shipped before them. It does not unload the
//! kernels — it only removes them from selection, so an A/B needs no rebuild.
