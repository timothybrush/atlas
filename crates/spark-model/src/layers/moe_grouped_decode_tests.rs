//! The grouped-GEMM MoE decode arm is a WIDTH trade, and the gate that
//! decides it is the whole fix (#415 follow-up).
//!
//! Before this, the arm was gated on `AVAROK_MOE_GROUPED_DECODE=1` alone —
//! width-blind. That is wrong in both directions and each direction has a
//! measurement behind it:
//!
//! - env set, n=4: ran, and LOSES badly (31 vs 56 tok/s on Holo)
//! - env unset, n=32: did NOT run, forgoing a measured +25% (SSM-side C=32
//!   172.7 -> 216.2) and #415's +7.9%/+9.7%
//!
//! and since no recipe ever set the variable, the shipped behaviour was the
//! second one everywhere: the win existed and was never realised.
//!
//! Tests target the PURE decider so neither polarity depends on process env
//! or on `OnceLock` latch order.
