//! ★ WHERE THE ENVIRONMENT MAY BE READ. One table, one enforcement.
//!
//! `std::env::var` allocates a `String` and takes the PROCESS-WIDE
//! environment lock; `var_os` skips the allocation but still takes the lock.
//! So concurrent decode threads SERIALISE against each other on every read,
//! and the cost grows with concurrency — MEASURED on GB10, one resolve of ~30
//! variables costs 0.57 us single-threaded, **4.00 us at 8 threads and
//! 5.76 us at 16**. That growth is precisely why no single-stream benchmark
//! ever showed it, and why `ModelLevers::from_env` was called **32,513 times
//! in one `concurrency-sweep`** while its own doc claimed "called once".
//!
//! These are source-level checks because the property is "who may read the
//! environment", which no runtime assertion can observe.
//!
//! To add a file here, do NOT add its hot function to the allow list — move
//! the variable into [`super::ModelLevers`] (or the module's own levers
//! struct) and read the resolved field instead.

/// Files on a per-token, per-layer or per-forward path, each with the
/// functions in it that are still ALLOWED to read the environment.
///
/// An empty allow list means the file must not read the environment at all.
/// Paths are relative to `crates/spark-model/src`.
