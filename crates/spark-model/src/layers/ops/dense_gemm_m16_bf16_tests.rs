//! HOST SIMULATION of `dense_gemm_m16_bf16`'s INDEX MATH — the cp.async
//! staging map, the per-lane m16n8k16 fragment gather and the accumulator ->
//! `[M, N]` store map — checked against a reference GEMM in the scalar
//! `dense_gemv_bf16`'s own reduction order.
//!
//! WHY A SIMULATION AND NOT ONLY THE GPU ORACLE. The GPU oracle
//! (`examples/native_bf16_lm_head_m16_microtest.rs`) runs the real 2.54 GB head
//! and needs an H100; this runs in CI on a laptop and is the thing that says
//! WHERE a mismatch is. Round 6 of the FFN campaign spent a machine-day
//! deciding whether a red cell was a row/pitch defect or the oracle's metric
//! (`dense_ffn_m16_tc_m32_tests.rs`); the index math is pinned here so that
//! question is answerable without one.
//!
//! The simulation is faithful to the three maps it is about — it does NOT
//! shortcut to "row r dot column c":
//!
//! 1. **Staging.** Every one of the 128 threads runs the kernel's own chunk
//!    map (A: `row = tid>>3`, `col = (tid&7)*8`; B: the same, `B_CHUNKS` times
//!    at 16-row strides) into a padded `[STAGES][rows][72]` shared tile, with
//!    the hand zero-fill for `row >= M` and `gn >= N`.
//! 2. **Fragments.** The 16x16 A tile and 8x16 B tile each MMA consumes are
//!    REBUILT from the per-lane `a0..a3` / `b0,b1` smem reads, so a wrong
//!    `group_id`/`quad`/`kc` term shows up as a wrong tile rather than being
//!    assumed away.
//! 3. **Store.** The four accumulator registers stay per-lane and are written
//!    out through the kernel's `(group_id, group_id+8) x (quad*2, quad*2+1)`
//!    map, masked to `[M, N]`.
//!
//! The MMA's internal 16-product order is unspecified hardware, so the
//! sequential model here is one plausible realisation — which is the point: the
//! contract is a tolerance ([`within_m16_tc_budget`], shared with
//! `w8a16_gemm_m16`), and it must hold whichever realisation the part picks.
//!
//! N=70 deliberately: it is a multiple of neither CTA width, so the last CTA is
//! partial on BOTH instantiations and the `gn >= N` zero-fill and the `col < N`
//! store mask are both exercised. K=384 is six 64-wide pipeline steps, so the
//! 4-stage ring wraps twice.
