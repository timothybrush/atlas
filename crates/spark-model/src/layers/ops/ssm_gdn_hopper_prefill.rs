//! The Hopper GDN chunked-prefill remnant twins: shared-memory SSOT and the
//! grammar of the lever that selects them (#928).
//!
//! The kernels are `kernels/hopper/common/gdn_fwd_o_hopper.cu` and
//! `..._recompute_wu_hopper.cu`, which exist only under `kernels/hopper`, so
//! their [`spark_runtime::gpu::KernelHandle`]s resolve on that target and are
//! `KernelHandle(0)` everywhere else. That — not an env var — is what keeps
//! gb10, b200 and strix on their parents.
//!
//! WHY THEY EXIST, in one receipt (full derivation in
//! `GDN-PREFILL-ATTRIBUTION.md`): on 1xH100 / Qwen3.8-27B-FP8, nsys round 9
//! (2026-09-11) put `gated_delta_rule_chunk_fwd_o` at 20.1 ms of a 368.3 ms
//! 1193-token prefill (5.5%; 71.9 ms at 4593 tokens) and
//! `gated_delta_rule_recompute_wu` at 14.9 ms (4.0%; 47.5 ms). Both already
//! run their BIG matmuls on `mma.sync` — 16-17 and 12-14.5 TFLOP/s, 4.4x the
//! scalar state spine — so what is left in them is the scalar remainder:
//! `fwd_o`'s triangular `tril(kq).uc`, 0.53 of its 3.68 MFLOP on 128 of its
//! 512 threads, and `wu`'s two forward substitutions, 79-85% of that kernel
//! per its own 2026-08-22 solve-removed probe.
//!
//! ONE LEVER FOR THE FAMILY. `ATLAS_GDN_PREFILL_TC` already selects the
//! tensor-core state spine; it now selects these two as well wherever the
//! image carries them, because the three kernels are one pipeline and an
//! operator who wants the TC prefill wants all of it. The A/B that needs them
//! apart gets `ATLAS_NO_GDN_PREFILL_TC_REMNANTS=1`, which keeps the spine and
//! leaves `wu`/`fwd_o` on their parents — one variable, in the direction that
//! is safe to be wrong about.
