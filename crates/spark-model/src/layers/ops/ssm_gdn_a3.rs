    // 5.6% of FP32 peak, 2.7% of HBM and 0.38% of bf16 tensor-core peak with
    // ZERO mma instructions issued. Its per-chunk cost is FLAT in T (53.6 us at
    // 19 chunks, 54.4 us at 72) at ~95 000 cycles against a one-SM FP32 floor of
    // 16 384, so it is latency-bound on the 64-deep dependent FMA chain, not

    // is that a spine change can read cos=1.0000 and still cost 1.4 BFCL points
