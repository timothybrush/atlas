//! Opt-in FlashInfer GDN prefill via `dlopen(libatlasgdn.so)` — behind `AVAROK_GDN_FLASHINFER=1`.
//!
//! Bridges Atlas's native packed-QKV + interleaved gate/beta buffers to the AOT-exported
//! FlashInfer chunked gated-delta-rule scan (tensor-core, ~11× the scalar FLA `chunk_delta_h`
//! at the Holo shape — see `3rdparty_patches/gdn_aot/STATUS.md`). The C-ABI shim
//! (`atlas_gdn_prefill_packed`) takes Atlas's exact native pointers: it deinterleaves
//! gate/beta in-shim and reads q/k/v straight out of the packed buffer via `conv_dim`
//! strides (no copy). Atlas's `gate` is already linear α (the kernel does the `logf`),
//! so there is NO gate-space conversion.
//!
//! dlopen (not link-time) keeps this fully opt-in: the binary builds and runs without the
//! library; it is only loaded when the flag is set. `AVAROK_GDN_LIB` overrides the path.
