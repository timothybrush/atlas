//! HOST SIMULATION of the INDEX ALGEBRA of the two Hopper GDN prefill remnant
//! twins, plus the lever grammar that selects them (#928).
//!
//! Neither kernel can run anywhere this repository's CI or its GB10 boxes can
//! reach — they exist only under `kernels/hopper` and need an sm_90a device —
//! so everything about them that is decidable WITHOUT a GPU is decided here,
//! and the arithmetic half is in `ssm_gdn_remnants_numerics_tests.rs`.
//!
//! What is at risk is not the arithmetic; an `mma.sync` accumulates in f32
//! whatever it is handed. It is the maps that decide WHAT it is handed, because
//! both twins moved from "one thread owns one column, loop over rows" to "one
//! lane owns a scattered C fragment", so every quantity is now addressed by
//! warp and lane rather than by a loop variable:
//!
//!   1. `fwd_o`'s output fragment, 4 m-tiles x 4 n-quarters over [64][128];
//!   2. `fwd_o`'s Gram fragment, 4 x 4 tiles of 16 over [64][64], which is also
//!      where the causal mask and the decay fold now happen — the parent left
//!      the `l > i` half holding raw Gram values because its consumer looped
//!      `l <= i`, and an MMA has no such loop bound;
//!   3. `wu`'s L-build fragment, the same 16x16 tiling, which must cover the
//!      four DIAGONAL blocks exactly once for the T_jj inverses to be defined;
//!   4. `wu`'s per-warp [64][16] panel and its transposed publish, which is the
//!      single most plausible slip in the blocked solve and leaves every shape
//!      and bound legal;
//!   5. the padded 136/72/24 row strides, which exist to make the fragment
//!      reads bank-conflict-free and which silently read the wrong column if
//!      the launcher and the kernel disagree about the footprint.
