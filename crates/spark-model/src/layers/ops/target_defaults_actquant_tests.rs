/// Hopper ships it ON with no accuracy receipt because there is no accuracy
/// question: the twin's output is bit-identical to its parent's. The claim is

/// 18.6–19.1 %, 3.30–3.59× — and it is a claim the row alone does not qualify,

/// GB10 declares it OFF: `fp8_act_quant_hopper.cu` lives under
/// `kernels/hopper` only, so the lookup returns 0 there and the row is inert.
/// It is declared anyway, so the lever list is one list.
