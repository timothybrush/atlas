//! `not(unix)` counterpart of [`super::gdn_flashinfer`].
//!
//! The real module reaches the FlashInfer GDN kernel through
//! `dlopen("libatlasgdn.so")` — POSIX dynamic loading, and a `.so` that is only
//! built for Linux. Windows has neither, so the path is unavailable there.
//!
//! That is not a degradation introduced here: the feature is opt-in behind
//! `AVAROK_GDN_FLASHINFER=1`, and its own docs note that "the binary builds and
//! runs without the library". Both call sites are already guarded by
//! [`available`] and fall back to the scalar FLA scan, so reporting `false`
//! here reproduces exactly what a unix host does when the library is absent or
//! the flag is unset.
//!
//! Declared under the same module path as the real one (`ops::gdn_flashinfer`)
//! so the two call sites need no `cfg`.
