//! WHICH per-token FP8 activation quantizer this build launches, and on what
//! grid.
//!
//! Two kernels compute the same bytes. The SHARED one
//! (`kernels/gb10/common/per_token_group_quant_fp8.cu`) spends one 128-thread
//! CTA on one 128-element K-group — one bf16 element per thread, a 256-byte
//! load per CTA — and measures 633/641/636 GB/s on an H100, 18.9-19.1% of HBM,
//! for 10.36% of a 4593-token prefill (#928; round-13 nsys, cell T1N). The
//! HOPPER twin (`kernels/hopper/common/fp8_act_quant_hopper.cu`) gives each
//! group 16 threads of one `uint4` each and packs 8 groups into a CTA, so the
//! CTA's load is 2 KB. Its output is BIT-IDENTICAL by contract — see that file
//! and `native_fp8_act_quant_hopper_microtest`.
//!
//! Selected by PRESENCE **and by WIDTH**. The twin exists only under
//! `kernels/hopper` (`[kernels] overrides`), so on gb10/b200/strix
//! `try_kernel` misses and the shared kernel runs. On Hopper the choice is
//! then `[defaults] fp8_act_quant_hopper` plus a CTA-count floor, because
//! presence alone shipped a 0.76x-0.95x REGRESSION at every decode width
//! (round-16 receipt SS 2.1, Recommendation 2). The rule, the per-K
//! thresholds and the once-per-branch route line live in
//! `fp8_act_quant_floor.rs`; this file owns the PAIR and the two grids.
//!
//! There is still no numeric A/B to arm — the two kernels emit the same bytes
//! — so `AVAROK_FP8_ACT_QUANT_HOPPER=0` is a SPEED kill switch, and the control
//! for the GB/s claim remains a build without the file.
//!
//! [`Fp8ActQuant`] is a PAIR rather than a single resolved handle because the
//! two kernels need DIFFERENT grids, and a bare `KernelHandle` cannot say which
//! it is. Carrying the pair makes the mismatch unrepresentable: the grid is
//! computed from the same value that chose the entry point, in one place
//! ([`fp8_quant_grid`]), and every layer that holds a quantizer holds this.
