//! The Hopper BA-gates twin: its launch geometry, and the grammar of the lever
//! and the guards that select it (#928).
//!
//! The kernel is `kernels/hopper/common/ssm_ba_gates_hopper.cu`, which exists
//! only under `kernels/hopper`, so its [`KernelHandle`] is `KernelHandle(0)`
//! on gb10, b200 and strix and the launcher stays on the gb10 parent there
//! without reading anything. That — not an env var — is what keeps the other
//! targets on `ssm_preprocess::dense_gemm_ba_gates_prefill`.
//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS, in one receipt (full derivation in
//! `SSM-BA-GATES-ATTRIBUTION.md`). The parent launches
//! `Grid: (ceil(N/4), M_tokens, 1) Block: (256,1,1)`: one CTA computes four of
//! the `N = ssm_ba_size = 2*nv` BA outputs for one token, and each of those
//! four walks the token's entire `K` activation row — the CTA's 256 threads are
//! four 64-lane groups, one per output. At the Qwen3.8-27B geometry `N=96`,
//! `K=5120` that is 24 CTAs per token and **96 reads of every activation row**,
//! one per BA output. nsys, 1xH100 80GB HBM3, Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 @
//! `815c9f160`, round 13 cell T1: the kernel is 26 881.8 us = 5.85% of the
//! 4593-token prefill and 6 896.3 us = 3.13% of the 1168-token forward, 555.04
//! us per launch at `M=4576`, observed grid `(24, 4576)`, 88 GB/s of compulsory
//! traffic — 2.6% of HBM, so this was never a bandwidth problem. The twin reads
//! the row 12 times and issues ~1.8x fewer instructions (SASS, sm_90a).
//!
//! BIT-IDENTICAL, and that is the contract, not an aspiration: the twin keeps
//! the parent's lane-strided `kv` sweep, its 5-step shuffle butterfly and its
//! `warp_even + warp_odd` cross-warp order, and only hoists A's (exact) bf16 ->
//! f32 widening out of the output loop. `native_ssm_ba_gates_hopper_microtest`
//! asserts byte equality of `gate` and `beta`, not a tolerance.
//!
//! ⚠️ **THE TOKEN-COUNT GUARD IS LOAD-BEARING.** One CTA per token means the
//! grid IS the token count, and this kernel is on the BATCHED DECODE path too
//! (`trait_decode_batched.rs`; nsys round 13 SS C.2 prices it at 227.5 us/step
//! over 48 launches at n=16). A 16-row step would put 16 CTAs on 132 SMs where
//! the parent puts 384. [`ssm_ba_gates_hopper_reject`] declines below
//! `MIN_CTAS_PER_SM * sm_count` tokens and the parent runs, so promoting this
//! lever cannot cost the decode step.
