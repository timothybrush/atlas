//! Model-side kernel-path levers, resolved once and then carried.
//!
//! # ★ THE ENVIRONMENT IS READ EXACTLY ONCE PER PROCESS. KEEP IT THAT WAY.
//!
//! Every `ATLAS_*` variable below is a process constant: nothing mutates the
//! environment after start (the runtime `set_var` that once could was
//! deliberately removed — see `main_modules/serve_load.rs` and `config.rs`).
//! So resolving them more than once is pure waste, and on a hot path it is
//! worse than waste:
//!
//! * `std::env::var` allocates a `String` per read, and
//! * it takes the PROCESS-WIDE environment lock, so concurrent readers
//!   SERIALISE against each other.
//!
//! MEASURED on GB10: one resolve of the ~30 variables here costs 0.57 us
//! single-threaded but **4.00 us at 8 threads and 5.76 us at 16** — the cost
//! grows with concurrency, which makes it invisible to any single-stream
//! benchmark. `from_env()` was called **32,513 times in one
//! `concurrency-sweep`** (48 layers x ~680 prefills) while its own doc claimed
//! it was "called once, when the model is built".
//!
//! **The rule for this module and anything like it:** read the environment in
//! ONE place, at ONE time, and pass the resolved value down. Use
//! [`ModelLevers::get`] for the process-wide copy; take `levers` from the
//! `ForwardContext` or the model when you already have one. If you find
//! yourself calling anything named `*_from_env`, `resolve_*` or `*_env()`
//! inside a function that runs per token, per layer, per forward pass or per
//! request, that is the bug this note exists to prevent.
//!
//! The second of the two lever categories on [`crate::layer::ForwardContext`]:
//!
//! * [`super::GemmDispatch`] — which GEMM implementation each projection takes.
//! * [`ModelLevers`] — everything else the model's kernel paths branch on:
//!   the SSM/GDN recurrence variant, FFN routing, MoE quantization, LoRA
//!   application mode, diagnostics.
//!
//! Both were `OnceLock<bool>` statics reading `ATLAS_*` at first touch. Two
//! problems with that, and only the first is about hot-swap:
//!
//! 1. A static outlives the model whose flags it encodes. Load a second model
//!    whose recipe sets different levers and the process keeps taking the
//!    previous model's branches — silently, because a cached `bool` cannot
//!    report that it is stale.
//! 2. It hides the dependency. A function that reads the environment through a
//!    static declares nothing in its signature, cannot be exercised with a
//!    different configuration without mutating the process, and gives the
//!    compiler nothing to check.
//!
//! Carrying it fixes both, and a site that forgets the field fails to build.

/// Kernel-path levers for one loaded model.
///
/// Plain `Copy` data resolved from the environment at model construction. Group
/// membership follows the subsystem the lever steers, so a reader can see at a
/// glance which part of the forward pass a flag reaches.
// `Eq` is deliberately absent since `draft_conf_tau` joined: it is an f32
// threshold. Comparing two resolutions is a test-only need and `PartialEq`
// covers it.
