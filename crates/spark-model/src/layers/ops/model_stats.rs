//! [`ModelStats`] — diagnostic counters and one-shot latches owned by the model.
//!
//! Sibling to [`ModelLevers`](super::ModelLevers): the levers say what a model's
//! kernels *do*, this records what they *did*. Both are owned by
//! `TransformerModel` and lent to every `ForwardContext`.
//!
//! Telemetry is not exempt from scoping. A counter that spans a model swap
//! averages two models together and describes neither, and a one-shot dump
//! latch that has already fired suppresses the *next* model's dump — the exact
//! artifact someone asked for by setting the flag. Nothing here changes
//! generation, so the failure is a wrong measurement rather than a wrong
//! answer; for a diagnostic those are the same kind of defect.
//!
//! Counters are atomics because they are mutated through the shared `&` that
//! `ForwardContext` hands out. The change from the statics they replace is
//! where they live, not how they are written.
