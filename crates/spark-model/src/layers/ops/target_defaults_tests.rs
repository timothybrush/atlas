//! The per-target serving-default resolution table, pinned.
//!
//! Three properties, and the middle one is the whole point of the change:
//!
//! 1. **Hopper resolves to its measured configuration with an EMPTY
//!    environment.** What used to live in a launch script outside this repo is
//!    now reproducible from the binary alone.
//! 2. **GB10 with an empty environment is byte-for-byte today's behaviour.**
//!    Asserted against the literals every resolver hardcoded before this
//!    module existed, so "GB10 is unchanged" is a test rather than a claim.
//! 3. **The environment still wins, and says so.** Every lever is overridable
//!    in BOTH directions and reports [`Source::Env`] when it was.
//!
//! The tables are constructed here rather than read from
//! `kernels/*/HARDWARE.toml`: this file grades the RESOLVER. That the
//! checked-in TOML actually holds these values is
//! `atlas-kernels/tests/target_defaults.rs`, which parses the real files with
//! the real build-script parser.
