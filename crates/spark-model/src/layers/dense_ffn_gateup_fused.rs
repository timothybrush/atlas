//! The FUSED dense-FFN gate+up DECODE GEMM — one block-scaled FP8 cuBLASLt
//! call at `N = 2 * intermediate` in place of two at `N = intermediate`.
//!
//! # WHY (#927)
//!
//! nsys `--cuda-graph-trace=node`, 1xH100 80GB HBM3, `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8` @
//! `3717cb05e`, round 13 cell V, median `n = 16` decode step **19.887 ms** of
//! kernel busy (`h100-r13-attribution.md` §§C.2–C.4). Resolved by grid shape,
//! the dense FFN's gate and up projections are **128 graph nodes, 5 730.5 µs =
//! 44.77 µs/node**, `K = 5120` `N = 17408` each. At 89.1 MB of E4M3 weight per
//! node that is **1 991 GB/s = 59.4 % of HBM**.
//!
//! In the SAME step, on the SAME arm, moving the SAME bytes:
//!
//! | projection | K | N | nodes | µs/node | GB/s | % HBM |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | FFN gate + up | 5120 | 17408 | 128 | 44.77 | 1 991 | **59.4 %** |
//! | FFN `down` | 17408 | 5120 | 64 | 37.25 | 2 393 | 71.4 % |
//! | SSM `in_proj_qkvz` | 5120 | 16384 | 48 | 34.21 | 2 453 | 73.2 % |
//!
//! `down` reads the same 89.1 MB as one of the gate/up nodes and is 7.5 µs
//! faster; the difference between the 59.4 % arm and the 71–73 % arms is that
//! the first issues **two launches per layer for one weight pass**. The weight
//! bytes are read once either way — this is not a traffic saving. One launch
//! of twice the N halves the per-launch fixed cost and doubles the tile count
//! per wave, which is what the 71.4 % row already demonstrates on this card.
//! At an 80 % target the pair costs `11.41 GB / (0.8 × 3.35 TB/s) = 4.26 ms`
//! against a measured 5 730.5 µs → **1 476 µs/step, 7.4 % of the step** and
//! the largest single decode kernel item in the round-13 table.
//!
//! # Numerics: a bit claim, not a tolerance
//!
//! The fused weight is the two `[inter, K]` E4M3 blocks appended along N, and
//! its `[N/128, K/128]` FP32 block-scale grid is the two grids appended along
//! N/128. Splitting N therefore produces **independent output columns over the
//! same K with the same scales**: output element `(m, j)` of the fused GEMM is
//! the same dot product, in the same order, as element `(m, j)` of gate (for
//! `j < inter`) or `(m, j - inter)` of up. Same cuBLASLt op, same epilogue.
//! `examples/native_fp8_ffn_gateup_fused_microtest.rs` asserts **byte
//! equality** of both halves at `M ∈ {5, 8, 16}` rather than a cosine.
//!
//! # Layout, and why it is N-concatenation rather than an interleave
//!
//! The fused output is `[m, 2*inter]` with gate in columns `[0, inter)` and up
//! in `[inter, 2*inter)` — a row is `[gate | up]`. Three things stay simple
//! that a tile-interleave would complicate: the loader's fused weight is a
//! straight device-to-device append, its scale grid is the same append one
//! row-block wider, and **each half remains addressable as an un-fused
//! `Fp8Weight` VIEW**, so every other rung of `dense_ffn.rs`'s `w8_gemm!`
//! ladder keeps working on the same bytes with no change at all. The consumer
//! pays a row stride instead of a flat index (`ops::silu_mul_strided`), and
//! coalescing survives it: a row half is `inter` contiguous BF16 — 34 816 B at
//! these shapes — so every warp's 128-byte segments are whole and only the
//! jump BETWEEN rows differs.
//!
//! # Residency: net zero, by construction
//!
//! A second copy of gate+up is 178.3 MB × 64 layers = **11.4 GB**, which would
//! not fit beside the bs32 KV budget. So the loader does not make one: it
//! builds the fused buffer, re-points `gate_proj` and `up_proj` at VIEWS
//! inside it, and `Qwen35DenseWeightLoader::prune_after_load` releases the two
//! source store tensors the copy consumed. Steady-state delta is zero, and
//! `predicted_residency` prices it as zero for the preflight ring fit. The
//! load-time transient is one layer's 178.3 MB at a time against the store
//! tensors that have not been pruned yet — the same shape, and the same
//! precedent, as the SSM `[QKV|Z]` concat that has shipped since #915.
//!
//! # Band
//!
//! 5..=[`spark_runtime::buffers::GATEUP_FUSED_MAX_M`] rows.
//!
//! * **Below 5** rung 1 of `w8_gemm!` (`w8a16_gemv_batch4`) owns the width and
//!   already makes ONE pass over each weight; there is no second launch to
//!   fuse, and the W8A8 rule this arm rides on starts at `m > 4` anyway.
//! * **Above 16** the arm stops because the saving does. At the prefill widths
//!   these same two GEMMs run at **68.6 % of FP8 PEAK** (M=4576,
//!   `h100-r13-attribution.md` §A.4) — compute-bound, where a launch buys
//!   nothing measurable — and the attribution's own advice is to keep the
//!   lever scoped to decode until a prefill microtest says otherwise.
//!
//! The lever is `[defaults] ffn_gateup_fused`: **hopper `true`**, gb10 and
//! b200 `false` (no receipt, and both declare `cublas_gemm_scope = "off"`, so
//! the arm this changes is not even armed there). The strided SiLU consumer
//! lives in `kernels/hopper/common/silu_mul_strided.cu` — HOPPER-OWNED
//! (`[kernels] overrides`, an addition), so the two other NVIDIA targets do
//! not compile a kernel they can never launch and no new cross-hardware
//! symlink is created. `ATLAS_FFN_GATEUP_FUSED=0` kills it; on gb10/b200
//! `=1` arms a lever whose kernel lookup returns 0 and the arm declines.
