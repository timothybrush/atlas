//! Per-sequence memory trace — the instrument A76's runtime gates are measured on.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every prior leak measurement on this box rested on two point reads of
//! `MemAvailable` per leg. That instrument moves by GBs for reasons unrelated to
//! requests, mixes driver commitments with reclaimable page cache, and on the one
//! buffer set whose true size is computable from source it over-read by +34 %
//! (ANOMALIES A75/A76 follow-up). A slope needs a per-request series, and a leak
//! verdict needs the driver leg separated from the host leg.
//!
//! So each line carries three independent readings taken at the same instant:
//!
//! * `live` — live device allocations on the backend's own ledger. A COUNT, and the
//!   decisive one: it is unaffected by allocator caching, page cache, or driver
//!   book-keeping. A leaking request raises it by a fixed number every time.
//! * `cumemgetinfo` — the driver leg alone, no `max(.., MemAvailable)` (A73).
//! * `memavailable` — the host leg, for continuity with the older measurements.
//!
//! Off unless `ATLAS_SEQ_MEMTRACE` is set (presence — `=0` is NOT "off"), so the
//! serving path pays one `OnceLock` read per sequence when it is off.
