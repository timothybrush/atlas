//! Capability gate: selecting a tier the model cannot populate is a STARTUP
//! ERROR, never a silent no-op.
//!
//! "Model-agnostic" does NOT mean every model has every tier. The SSM
//! snapshot tiers (Marconi spill, decode rollback ring) hold recurrent
//! state that only exists on hybrid SSM+attention models
//! ([`ModelConfig::has_recurrent_state`]); a pure-attention model — dense or
//! MoE — can never populate them. Before this gate, an SSM tier env var on
//! such a model was swallowed silently (the `num_ssm_layers > 0` arms in
//! `impl_a1` just skipped construction WITHOUT reading the vars, hiding even
//! hard misconfigurations like `AVAROK_SSM_DECODE_TIER=nvme` with no dir).
//! "Works on Holo, mysteriously does nothing on X" is exactly the failure
//! mode PCND forbids: require explicit config or fail fast.
//!
//! When the capability IS present — or when no tier var is set at all — this
//! gate reads env *presence* only and changes nothing: the byte-identical
//! default path is preserved.
