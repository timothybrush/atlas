//! Startup-static PEFT LoRA adapter: remap/validate/pack into the
//! fixed-address rank-padded pool. v0 = one adapter, slot 0, always on.
//!
//! NAMING: everything here is `Peft*`/`adapter_*`/`Lora*` (adapter sense) —
//! `kv_lora_rank`/`q_lora_rank` (atlas-core/src/config.rs:182-207) are MLA
//! vocabulary, not this.
//!
//! NOTE on leaks: the intermediate `WeightStore` device copies of the
//! unpadded A/B tensors become garbage after pool packing and are never
//! freed (no dealloc on weight structs anywhere in Atlas). Accepted at
//! holo adapter scale (~tens of MiB).
//!
//! SDD facade: the surface is split by functional seam into `types` (the
//! module/AB enums + weight/slot structs + `LoraWeights` impl), `slot_math`
//! (pure slot/offset placement + routing), `key` (classify + adapter identity),
//! `env` (the `$ATLAS_LORA_*` hatches + `validate_peft_config`), and `loading`
//! (audit/pack + the load entry points). Every public name re-exports at its
//! own visibility so `crate::lora::X` / `spark_model::lora::X` paths are stable.
