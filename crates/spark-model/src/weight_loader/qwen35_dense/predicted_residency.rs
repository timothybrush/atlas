//! The derived-weight residency of the native-FP8 dense route, predicted from
//! `config.json` alone — BEFORE the checkpoint loads.
//!
//! **WHY (#915 second pass).** `fp8_residency::DerivedResidency` tallies the
//! derived copies as the loader builds them, which is four minutes too late
//! for the one decision that needs the number: preflight's SSM decode-ring
//! auto-fit runs before the first byte of the checkpoint is read, and its
//! first pass therefore fitted the ring against PRE-LOAD free memory (78.6 GB
//! on an 80 GB H100) instead of against the post-load KV headroom the KV
//! budget stage actually enforces. Measured on 1xH100 2026-09-11
//! (`h100-round2-report.md`, stage 3/5): at `--max-batch-size 16` and 32 the
//! fitter stayed silent — 8 slots, 18.94 / 37.88 GB of ring — and the serve
//! was refused minutes later by
//! `factory/build.rs`'s `No memory left for KV cache`. The fit needs the
//! post-load figure, and the only part of it that is not already known at
//! preflight is how many bytes the loader will derive on top of the
//! checkpoint.
//!
//! It IS knowable: every derived copy on this route is shape arithmetic over
//! the config, and which copies get built is
//! [`fp8_residency::DenseFp8Plan::resolve`], a pure function of the
//! environment plus one backend question (are the two W8A8 prefill kernels
//! loaded). This module evaluates both without a `WeightStore`.
//!
//! **Round-6 receipt** (`h100-round6-report.md`; serve I, Qwen3.8-27B-FP8,
//! `ATLAS_DENSE_FP8=1`, `--lm-head-dtype bf16`, tp 1): the loader's own
//! summary line reported **derived 4.24 GB** on top of a 28.75 GB checkpoint.
//! Reproduced here from `kernels/gb10/qwen3.8-27b/MODEL.toml`'s shapes, plus
//! the GDN head geometry, which no MODEL.toml carries and which
//! `ModelConfig` therefore reads from the checkpoint's own `config.json`
//! (16x128 key heads, 48x128 value heads):
//!
//! | term | per layer | layers | total |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | attn FP8 K twin + V twin | 10,488,320 B | 16 | 0.168 GB |
//! | SSM fused `[QKV\|Z]` FP8 weight | 83,886,080 B | 48 | 4.027 GB |
//! | SSM `[QKV\|Z]` + out_proj block scales | 28,160 B | 48 | 0.001 GB |
//! | SSM `in_proj_ba` interleaved BF16 | 983,040 B | 48 | 0.047 GB |
//! | **total** | | | **4.243 GB** |
//!
//! Q and O twins are absent from that total because the round-6 target ships
//! both W8A8 prefill kernels, so `DenseFp8Plan` declines them — which is why
//! [`Fp8RouteInputs::w8a8_prefill_kernels`] is an input and not an assumption.
//!
//! **What this module deliberately refuses to predict.** Anything that
//! re-opens an NVFP4 fallback (`ATLAS_DENSE_FP8_KEEP_NVFP4`, the
//! `ATLAS_CUTLASS_NVFP4_*` levers, `ATLAS_ATTN_W4A4`) returns
//! [`DerivedBytesEstimate::Unavailable`] rather than a guess: those paths
//! resurrect 18+ GiB of copies whose byte count the loader tallies through
//! `skip`, not `keep`, so a prediction built on `keep` would be wrong by more
//! than the quantity being predicted. The caller falls back to its pre-load
//! behaviour and says so in the log.
