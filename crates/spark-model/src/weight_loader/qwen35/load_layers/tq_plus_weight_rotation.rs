//! TurboQuant+ weight pre-rotation.
//!
//! Folds the canonical S2·H·S1/sqrt(d) rotation into Q/K/V projection
//! weights at load time so the per-token `wht_bf16_inplace` dispatch on Q
//! and K/V can be skipped. For W_o, the inverse rotation R^T = S1·H·S2 is
//! folded into the input-side rows so the attention output (which is in
//! WHT-rotated V-basis) is brought back to original basis by o_proj alone
//! — no separate `wht_bf16_inplace_inv` launch needed.
//!
//! Per-token runtime savings (Qwen3.6-A3B at 40 attention layers):
//!   - Skip 1 wht_bf16_inplace on Q
//!   - Skip 1 wht_bf16_inplace on K
//!   - Skip 1 wht_bf16_inplace on V
//!   - Skip 1 wht_bf16_inplace_inv on attn output
//!
//! = 4 × 40 = 160 kernel launches saved per token
//!
//! Implementation: reuses the existing `wht_bf16_inplace` kernel. The
//! kernel processes `head_dim`-sized contiguous chunks indexed by
//! `blockIdx.x`, so a weight matrix laid out as `[hidden, n_heads * head_dim]`
//! can be rotated by treating each `head_dim` chunk as one "head" —
//! grid = `hidden * n_heads`, block = 32 (warp).
//!
//! For Q/K/V projections: weight rows are `[hidden, n_heads * head_dim]`
//! (column-major from a gemm viewpoint, or row-major if the loader
//! transposed). Either way, each head_dim chunk gets the canonical rotation.
//!
//! For O projection: weights are `[n_heads * head_dim, hidden]`. The
//! rotation is on the INPUT side per head, so the layout is identical to
//! Q/K/V but interpreted differently — same kernel applies.
