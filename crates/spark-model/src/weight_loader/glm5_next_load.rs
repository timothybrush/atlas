//! `Glm5NextWeightLoader` — assembles the 45-layer GLM-5.3 text stack from a `WeightStore`.
//!
//! Everything it calls already existed and was gated: `bind_kda_weights`, `build_dsa_weights`,
//! `glm5next_mlp::build`. This is the wiring, plus the one thing wiring must do that the pieces
//! cannot — decide, per layer, WHICH pieces.
//!
//! # Where the classification comes from
//!
//! Not from tensor names, and not from modular arithmetic. `Glm5NextTextSkeleton::from_config`
//! derives the mixer and MLP kind of all 45 layers from the checkpoint's own
//! `linear_attn_config` index lists and `first_k_dense_replace`, cross-checked against the
//! textual arrays, and refuses anything it was not taught. This loader iterates that.
//!
//! # TP, on every half
//!
//! DSA shards through `DsaTpPlan`, the MLP through `Glm5NextMlpConfig`, and KDA through
//! [`KdaShardedSource`] — an adapter that slices the host bytes **before** the proven
//! `bind_kda_weights` sees them, so TP=1 and TP=2 take the identical binder code path.
//!
//! 🪤 Both mixers end in a **row-parallel** `o_proj`, so the attention output is a partial sum
//! at TP>1 and `Glm5NextLayer::mixer_all_reduce` reduces it before the mHC highway sees it.
//! Half-applying the sharding — the state before this was wired — meant every rank computed a
//! WHOLE KDA block and the all-reduce double-counted it: no crash, no shape error.
