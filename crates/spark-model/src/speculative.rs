/// WHY. The MTP head is one module run autoregressively. Draft 1 consumes the

/// row is kept forever: `after_verify` trims only REJECTED rows. So every
/// accepted draft permanently contaminates the drafter's own context.
///
/// Measured on dgx2 (W4A4 27B, gate disarmed, seq_len ~10k, n=700/config):
/// unconditional per-position acceptance 0.660 -> 0.485 -> 0.407, i.e. the

/// (its ring is only written on SERIAL decode steps, and with the throughput
/// gate disarmed there are none), and dropping `ATLAS_MTP_DRAFTER_PREFILL`
/// costs only 0.017/0.030 (~1 sd).
///
/// WHAT THIS DOES. After a verify, the target's true hidden for every accepted
/// position is sitting in the verify hidden buffer. Ring those hiddens under
/// the same label convention the serial path uses, and have `after_verify`
/// additionally drop the `num_accepted - 1` accepted rows that were written
/// with a drafter hidden. The next propose's catch-up feed then rebuilds
/// exactly those rows from the ring, with the TARGET's hidden, through the
/// already-exercised `catchup_drafter` batch path. No new kernel, no new
/// state machine — it reuses the gap-fill machinery for a gap that was never

///
/// SAFETY. A wrong feed cannot corrupt output: verification rejects bad

/// The earlier note claimed the pair-key -> hidden mapping was wrong, inferred
/// from a sign reversal between a 67%-delivery and a 99%-delivery arm at
/// n=700 (+0.021 -> −0.023 on p2_uncond). **That inference is withdrawn.** The
/// two arms differed by only ~1.7 sd, neither was more than 1 sd from the
/// baseline, and they are not paired samples (each arm emits different text).
///
/// The mapping has since been VERIFIED DIRECTLY, with dumped hidden
/// fingerprints (`ATLAS_MTP_REFEED_DEBUG=1`, FNV-1a over each BF16 row), on
/// dgx2 / W4A4 27B / nd=2 / gate disarmed:
///
/// | check | result |
/// |---|---|
/// | ring D2D landed (`fp_src == fp_dst`) | 658 / 658 |
/// | fed hidden == live ring content at that label | 422 / 422 |
/// | `label == key + 1` and `RoPE == key + 1` on every feed | always |
/// | `fp(ring[position]) == fp(mtp_hidden_save)` at each propose | 302 / 304 (the 2 are a run's first propose) |
/// | **feed(key k) == `mtp_hidden_save` at the propose whose position was k+1** | **93 / 93** |
///
/// The last row is the non-tautological one: it compares the hidden this
/// feature feeds for pair key `k` against the hidden the drafter's own
/// `forward_one` consumed as `target_hidden` when it wrote pair key `k` —
/// two different code paths, bit-identical on every checkable case. So the
/// convention "ring label n holds hidden_{n−1}, hence pair key k reads label
/// k+1" is confirmed against an independently-exercised consumer.
///
/// What the earlier session DID find is real and is now fixed: the exclusive
/// `0..num_accepted` bound left one label unwritten per step, collapsing the
/// ring's contiguous window (458 fed / 231 missed = 67%). The bound is now
/// `0..=num_accepted` on both K=3 and K=4 (K=4 matters because
/// `mtp_rows_to_trim`'s extra trim is K-agnostic — without a K=4 ring write,
/// nd=3 would drop accepted drafter rows with nothing rebuilding them).
///
/// ## POWERED A/B (2026-07-21, dgx2): the pre-registered threshold is MET.
///
/// nd=2, gate disarmed, 16 documents x 8 turns, ~10k verify steps per arm
/// (with `ATLAS_MTP_GATE_FORCE=1` the engine is bit-reproducible, so n rises
/// only with NEW CONTENT, never with repetitions).
///
/// | arm | n | p1 | p2_uncond | tokens/verify step |
/// |---|---|---|---|---|
/// | OFF | 10,400 | 0.6100 | 0.4182 | 1.882 |
/// | ON  | 10,100 | 0.6262 | **0.4452** | 1.926 |
/// | delta | | +0.016 (2.4 sd) | **+0.027 (3.9 sd)** | **+2.3%** |
///
/// Criterion, pre-registered before the run: `p2_uncond` up by ≥ 0.015 at
/// ≥ 3 sd. Met. At n=700 — the sample that produced the earlier "refuted"
/// verdict — this same effect is ~1.0 sd, i.e. invisible. That verdict was a
/// power problem, not a mapping problem.
///
/// Caveat kept deliberately: the arms emit different text, so the binomial sd
/// understates the true variance. Content is matched (identical documents and
/// questions in both arms) but this is one measurement, not a replication.
/// STAYS DEFAULT OFF pending the standard gates (C2 smoke, A 35B

/// ## SIZE IT AGAINST THE REAL PRIZE BEFORE SPENDING ANY MORE TIME HERE
///
/// This lever is small BY CONSTRUCTION: it repairs at most
/// `num_accepted − 1` drafter KV **history** rows per step, while the measured
/// p1->p2 cliff happens WITHIN a single `propose`, where a history repair
/// cannot act at all. Two larger effects were measured the same night:
///
/// 1. **The drafter's own INPUT hidden at draft position >= 2** (dgx1's
///    teacher-forced oracle probe, `ATLAS_MTP_ORACLE_P2`): feeding draft 2 the
///    TARGET's true hidden instead of the MTP head's own takes p2_cond
///    0.5265 -> 0.7196, McNemar z = +18.4, recovering 1.40x the p1−p2 gap.
///    "Exposure bias" is refuted — the drafter is not mis-calibrated, it is
///    fed the wrong vector. That is **+0.193**, about **7x** this flag's
///    +0.027.
/// 2. **Drafter context blindness on WARM turns** (dgx2): the drafter holds
///    only **142 KV rows at sequence position 10,098**, because
///    `try_mtp_prefill_capture` no-ops whenever a prefill starts at a
///    reused-prefix boundary and the drafter prompt-prefill is then skipped.
///    Prefilling it on every turn measured **+0.086 p1 / +0.101 p2_uncond /
///    +10.2% accepted tokens per verify step** at n ~ 10k per arm, of which a
///    de-confounding pair (drafter coverage held at zero, prefix caching the
///    only variable) attributes **+0.079 p1 / +0.089 p2_uncond — 92% / 88% —
///    to drafter coverage** and the small remainder to warm restore.
///
/// Both dwarf this flag, and (2) also changes what this flag is worth: a
