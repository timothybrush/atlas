//! `Model` trait — the interface the scheduler talks to.
//!
//! ## Dispatch contract
//!
//! Per request, the scheduler invokes:
//!
//! 1. [`Model::prefill`] (or [`Model::prefill_chunk`] for chunked prefill)
//!    once per sequence. Returns logits at the last prompt position;
//!    populates the sequence's KV cache and SSM state.
//! 2. [`Model::decode`] once per emitted token. Returns next-token logits;
//!    extends KV/SSM state by one position. May be replaced by
//!    [`Model::decode_batch`] when multiple sequences are co-scheduled.
//! 3. Optional speculative-decode verify path: [`Model::decode_verify_graphed`]
//!    (K=2), [`Model::decode_verify_graphed_k3`] (K=3),
//!    [`Model::decode_verify_graphed_k4`] (K=4), or
//!    [`Model::decode_verify_graphed_kgamma`] (DFlash γ-token).
//!    These take [last_token, draft0, ..] and return per-position logits;
//!    the scheduler picks accept/reject and rolls back state on reject.
//! 4. [`Model::mixed_forward`] fuses one decode step + one prefill chunk
//!    through a single weight load; used by the scheduler to amortize
//!    weight-streaming cost when both phases are pending.
//!
//! Implementors live under `crates/spark-model/src/model/trait_impl/`,
//! split per phase (prefill_a/b/c/d, decode_a/b, verify_a/b/c/d) per
//! ADR-0006's multi-file module idiom.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! `Model: Send + Sync` — a single instance handles all sequences
//! concurrently. Per-sequence state lives in [`SequenceState`].
