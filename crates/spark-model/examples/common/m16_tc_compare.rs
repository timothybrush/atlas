//! Host half of `native_fp8_ffn_m16_tc_microtest.rs`, split out to keep that
//! example under the 500-LoC cap. Everything here runs on the CPU: the shape
//! table and the checkpoint draws, the loader's `_t` transpose, the guard and
//! gap audits, the per-case verdict and the line that reports it, and the two
//! known-bad controls that prove the comparison still bites. The example keeps
//! the GPU half — kernel handles, uploads, launches and timing.
//!
//! ⚠ THE ACCEPTANCE PREDICATE ITSELF IS NOT HERE AND MUST NOT BE COPIED HERE.
//! `within_m16_tc_budget` / `compare_m16_tc_block` live in the library, at
//! `layers::dense_ffn::m16_tc::oracle`, for the reason the example's header
//! gives: the microtest and the host simulation that pins the same contract
//! grade the tier with ONE predicate so the two cannot drift. A second copy in
//! `examples/` would be exactly the drift that arrangement exists to prevent.
//! This module only calls it.
//!
//! ⚠ THE ABSOLUTE FLOOR IS ROUND 6'S FIX, RE-SCALED IN ROUND 9, AND IT IS NOT
//! A LOOSENING. Round 6
//! failed `gate/up M=32` on `max_ulp 28`, 5 of 557,056 elements, `sign_flips 0`,
//! `rel_rms 4.2e-5`, and that was read as a possible row/pitch defect in the
//! two-halves rung. It was the metric: a host simulation of the same geometry
//! reproduces all five with no offset arithmetic at all, and every one is an
//! output that cancelled to |ref| 5.7e-6..1.6e-4 against a reference RMS of
//! 39.1 — 1e-7..4e-6 of the matrix scale, where an ordinal ULP has nothing left
//! to measure and one FP32 accumulation rounding spans hundreds of them. The
//! floor is four orders below the matrix RMS, so a real misplacement (errors of
//! order the RMS) still fails. ROUND 9 replaced round 6's fixed `2^-20 * rms`
//! with `8 * u32 * sqrt(K) * row_rms`, because the fixed constant did not scale
//! with the reduction depth and was fitted to THIS kernel pair — the BF16 LM
//! head's single 320-step FP32 chain is several times noisier and the constant
//! landed under its noise (`native_bf16_lm_head_m16_microtest`, H100 round 9:
//! `over_budget` 10/16/25/37 at M=5/8/13/16, every rejected element a logit
//! cancelled to 4.9e-6..2.6e-4 of the block RMS). Derivation:
//! `layers::dense_ffn::m16_tc::m16_tc_acc_floor`; both directions are pinned in
//! `dense_ffn_m16_tc_m32_tests.rs` and `ops/dense_gemm_m16_bf16_floor_tests.rs`.
//!
//! Sign flips below |scalar| < 0.05 are still counted separately rather than
//! graded: one ULP across zero is a full sign change. Nothing is silently
//! dropped — every rejected element is printed with its (row, col), which round
//! 6 could not do and which is why diagnosing it needed a second run.
//!
//! Test-only harness code; no serving path runs any of it.
