//! GPU oracle for the TENSOR-CORE 5..=32-row native-FP8 dense-FFN decode tier
//! (`ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC`, #927) — `w8a16_gemm_m16`.
//!
//! Runs the REAL Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 FFN shapes — gate/up `[17408, 5120]` and
//! down `[5120, 17408]` — at M in {1, 5, 8, 13, 16, 32} and compares against
//! the scalar `w8a16_gemv` each row's M=1 decode runs.
//!
//! 🔴 THE PASS CONDITION IS A TOLERANCE, NOT BIT-EQUALITY, and that is the
//! point of this file. `w8a16_gemv_batch16` (#927's tier) reduces each output
//! in ONE FP32 accumulator in strict K order and is bit-identical to the
//! scalar; an m16n8k16 MMA reduces 16 K-products in the tensor core's own order
//! first, so this kernel is not. The contract is ONE predicate, shared with the
//! host simulation so the two cannot drift:
//! `layers::dense_ffn::m16_tc::within_m16_tc_budget` — within 2 ordinal BF16
//! ULP, OR an absolute error under 2^-20 of the reference block's RMS — plus
//! `rel_rms <= 1e-3` over the block.
//!
//! The floor's derivation, the sign-flip accounting and the rest of the
//! criterion's prose now sit with the host half they grade, in
//! `examples/common/m16_tc_compare.rs`.
//!
//! It also pins the guards the wrapper promises — no write outside `[M, N]`
//! (rows past M and columns past N keep their sentinel), and the strided
//! sibling leaves the row-pitch gaps intact — and times the tier against the
//! two arms it competes with: `w8a16_gemv_batch16` (the bit-exact tier it would
//! displace) and `w8a16_gemm_n128_m128` (the transposed tile GEMM the FFN used
//! at these widths BEFORE #927, built here by transposing the weight on the
//! host the way the loader's `_t` copy does).
//!
//! THE STRIDED LEG NOW RUNS THE HALVES TOO. In round 6 it ran `m.min(16)` rows,
//! so at M=32 it re-measured rows 0..15 and its `strided_max_ulp=2` said
//! NOTHING about the rows the red cell was about. It now takes the same
//! two-halves route as the contiguous leg, at the padded pitches.
//!
//! `w8a16_gemm_m16_n64` — the `ATLAS_FFN_M16_TC_NTILE=64` arm — is measured
//! alongside, for numerics AND for GB/s: it is the candidate fix for round 6's
//! FFN serving regression (+13.7% at bs16 while the attention tiers went
//! −21.7%), whose leading hypothesis is gate/up's 544 CTAs overrunning the
//! H100's 528-CTA residency by one 16-CTA tail. It has no receipt; this is
//! where it gets one. WHY: `layers::dense_ffn::m16_tc`.
//!
//! Effective GB/s counts the FP8 WEIGHT bytes once per kernel pass: that is the
//! whole budget at decode widths and the number the tier exists to move. The
//! 17..=32 rung makes two passes by design, so its GB/s is against two.
//!
//! TIMING METHOD: `synchronize` + host `Instant` over N reps, the house pattern
//! (`examples/native_fp8_ffn_batch16_microtest.rs`).
//!
//! Run on the H100:
//!     cargo run --release --example native_fp8_ffn_m16_tc_microtest \
//!       --features cuda,gpu-examples
