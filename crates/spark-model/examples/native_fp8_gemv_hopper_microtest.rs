//! GPU oracle + receipt for the HOPPER-TUNED W8A16 M=1 decode GEMV (#928).
//!
//! WHY. nsys, 1xH100 SXM5, Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 (native FP8), 2026-09-11
//! round 10, C=1 steady-state decode step 18.5 ms, GPU idle 5%:
//! `w8a16_gemv` is 224 launches = 7.39 ms (40% of the step) and
//! `w8a16_gemv_dual` is 64 launches = 5.79 ms (31%). Together they move
//! 24.3 GB of FP8 weights per token in 13.2 ms = **1.84 TB/s** against HBM3's
//! 3.35 TB/s peak. `kernels/hopper/common/w8a16_gemv_hopper.cuh` diagnoses the
//! two reasons that is not the roofline — a shared-memory E4M3 LUT gather that
//! saturates the SM load/store unit, and one outstanding weight load per warp
//! at the small-N shapes the `ceil(N/4)` host grid cannot fill — and replaces
//! both. Target: >= 2.6 TB/s aggregate on these shapes.
//!
//! WHAT THIS PINS.
//!  * **Bit-identity as a hard `unequal=0`.** The arm under test is whatever
//!    `w8a16_gemv` the TARGET resolves — the Hopper override on an H100, the
//!    gb10 kernel everywhere else. The reference is [`host_gemv`], an EXACT
//!    host model of `kernels/gb10/common/w8a16_gemv.cu`'s reduction: the same
//!    64 lanes walking the same chunks in the same order, the same separate
//!    FMUL/FADD per element (`--fmad=false` is tree-wide, and Rust never
//!    contracts), the same five-step `shfl.down` butterfly, the same two-warp
//!    add, the same single `__float2bfloat16`. So `unequal=0` says the
//!    override changed the instruction selection and NOTHING about the
//!    arithmetic or its order. The dual is checked the same way, one
//!    projection at a time.
//!
//!    A HOST model rather than a second kernel, because on an H100 there is no
//!    second kernel to ask: `kernels/hopper/common/w8a16_gemv.cu` overrides
//!    the gb10 source, so a build for this target does not contain the chain
//!    it is being compared against. This arm used to borrow
//!    `w8a16_gemv_splitk` at `splits=1` as a surviving copy of that chain;
//!    that kernel was removed (#993) after the H100 microtest measured it a
//!    null (down 61.8 us split-K vs 58.9 us staged scalar), and borrowing a
//!    kernel kept alive for an unrelated lever was never the reason the oracle
//!    was sound.
//!  * **The extent.** Every output buffer carries 64 sentinel bytes either
//!    side, re-stamped before each route, so a short or long write is a
//!    failure rather than a silent pass.
//!  * **The timings** the override exists for, at all six real decode shapes
//!    plus the dual: sync'd `Instant` over 20 reps, us and GB/s of FP8 weight
//!    bytes, and the ms/step those launch counts buy. There is deliberately NO
//!    "before" column: the kernel this replaces is not in an H100 build, and a
//!    stand-in's time is not that kernel's time. The GB10 number to compare
//!    against is this same example run on a GB10 box, where `w8a16_gemv`
//!    resolves to the gb10 source.
//!
//! TIMING METHOD: `synchronize` + host `Instant` over `REPS`, the house
//! pattern (`examples/native_fp8_ffn_down_gemv_microtest.rs`). `GpuBackend`
//! exposes event record and synchronize but no elapsed-time query.
//!
//! Run on the H100 (no env changes — the override is selected by target):
//!     cargo run --release --example native_fp8_gemv_hopper_microtest \
//!       --features cuda,gpu-examples
