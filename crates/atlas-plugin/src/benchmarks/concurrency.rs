//! Concurrency Sweep — the latency/throughput curve.
//!
//! Port of `bench/bench_concurrency.py`: for every (ISL × concurrency) cell,
//! fire `conc` streaming requests at once and report client TTFT / TPOT / E2E
//! as p50/p90/p99 plus the aggregate output throughput of the batch. One cell
//! per `next()`, so the pane paints a row as soon as it exists and cancellation
//! lands within one cell rather than at the end of the sweep.
//!
//! ★ A cell's tok/s is only as real as the tokens behind it. The 2026-08-15
//! re-scope: the counting prompt produced C=1 cells of 49-token bursts and
//! C≥4 cells with 0–1 output tokens (E2E==TTFT, TPOT 0.0, aggregate
//! DECREASING with C) on a serve where a natural code-generation prompt
//! completed the full 800-token budget at every C (C=1: 31.9 → C=16: 170.1
//! aggregate tok/s). The instrument was broken, not the server. Hence: the
//! natural code-generation fixture is the default, every request's delivered
//! evidence is recorded, and cells below the vacuity floor are flagged
//! non-comparable instead of silently reported.
