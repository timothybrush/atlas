//! The registered BFCL benchmark descriptors.
//!
//! Three descriptors, two of which are gates and differ ONLY in their draw:
//! `bfcl-subset` is the golden n=995 MLPerf-edge draw (the dense 27B's gate)
//! and `bfcl-subset-echolp` is the n=1004 echolp draw (the 35B MoE's gate,
//! because that is the only draw its recorded history is on). Their scores are
//! NOT interchangeable — the category mix alone moves
//! `normalized_single_turn_score` by ~1.8 points while leaving
//! `overall_accuracy` in the same place, which is exactly what makes crossing
//! them easy to miss and impossible to catch after the fact.
