/// Where one leg's per-sample output is written, KEYED BY BENCHMARK ID.

/// ★ It used to be the bare `responses.jsonl` for every leg, which was fine
/// while `bfcl-subset` was one run and became wrong the moment it became a
/// GROUP. A sharded gate runs five legs — the whole draw and four quarters —
/// one after another against the same artifact directory, so each leg
/// destroyed its predecessor's output and only the last survived. The scoring
/// error even promised otherwise ("responses.jsonl is kept, so this can be
/// rescored"), which was true for exactly one of the five.
///
/// That output is not a convenience. For #936 it is the ONLY evidence that
/// distinguishes "the split reproduces the whole" from "the two happen to
/// score the same" — two different sets of answers can total identically, and
/// an aggregate that matches is what made an earlier reading of this bug wrong.
/// A per-sample diff needs both sides to still exist.
/// ★ THE SHARD IS PART OF THE KEY, and the benchmark id alone is NOT enough.
/// `Bfcl::descriptor()` returns `self.variant.descriptor()`, and a shard carries
/// the BASE variant plus a `shard` field — so `bfcl-subset-a` reports the id
/// `bfcl-subset`, exactly like the group and like its three siblings. Keying on
/// the id alone therefore left all five legs writing one filename, which is the
/// collision this function exists to prevent.
///
/// Caught by running it, not by reasoning about it: the first sharded leg after
/// the id-only fix reported "wrote no per-sample output", because the harness
/// looked for `responses-bfcl-subset-a.jsonl` and the leg had written
/// `responses-bfcl-subset.jsonl` on top of the whole draw's.
