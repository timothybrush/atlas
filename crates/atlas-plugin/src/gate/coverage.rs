//! Which changes invalidate which gate — the deterministic floor.
//!
//! Before this module there was one bit of information: did the diff touch
//! [`PERF_PATHS`]? If yes, every record for every gate was invalid. That is
//! simultaneously too coarse and too narrow. Too coarse because `PERF_PATHS`
//! contains the string `crates`, so editing argument parsing re-opened two BFCL
//! accuracy legs at roughly three and a half GPU-hours each. Too narrow because
//! a path outside the list invalidated nothing at all, however dangerous.
//!
//! # The polarity is deliberate: exclude, do not claim
//!
//! The obvious design is for each benchmark to *claim* the regions it covers,
//! and to require a gate when a changed path is claimed. That design fails
//! **open**: the moment someone adds a new module and forgets to claim it, it
//! is covered by nothing and silently gates nothing.
//!
//! So this inverts it. Every boundary path invalidates every gate, and the only
//! way to subtract is an [`Exclusion`] carrying a written [`Exclusion::rationale`].
//! Forgetting therefore costs a re-run, never a missed regression — the same
//! asymmetry `mod.rs` already states about the boundary itself: over-broad
//! costs a re-run, under-broad is a lie.
//!
//! # This file guards itself
//!
//! An exclusion table that could exempt the file it lives in would be a lock
//! whose key is kept inside it: a PR could add "exclude everything", and that
//! very edit would trigger no gate. So a diff touching any [`BOUNDARY_FILES`]
//! entry invalidates **every** gate, and a test asserts those files appear in
//! no exclusion set.

/// A path prefix that does **not** invalidate a particular gate.
///

    //   28.0–28.1 tok/s, mean 28.03, sigma ~0.05; the BENCH.toml floor
    //   (27.0, noise 0.5) is set from that set, not from three points.
    // * `concurrency-sweep`: it could not be REQUIRED while its entries were
    //   thresholds-less (check_record refuses a thresholds-less PASS). The
    //   dense Qwen3.8-27B entry now carries measured floors from an n=3
    //   ladder on the fixed instrument (C=1/4/8/16, isl 512, osl 320, zero
    //   vacuous cells), and the entry's param_overrides pin that instrument
    //   so a gate run reproduces it.

/// Registered benchmarks that are deliberately **not** gates, each with the
/// reason. Stated rather than implied: a reader asking "why doesn't
/// `bfcl-full` gate?" should find the answer here, not infer it from absence.
/// Gates that are NOT required **yet**, but are on a declared promotion path.
///
/// ★ The difference from [`NOT_REQUIRED`] is the whole point. Its permanently
/// excused entries carry a reason: `bfcl-full` duplicates cheaper coverage,
/// `quick-speed-bench` is a measurement tool, `serve-matrix` measures breadth.
/// Nothing is owed for them, ever.
///
/// A promotion candidate is different: it is a gate we intend to require once
/// it has proven itself, run on release cuts in the meantime. That leaves a gap
/// with a shape this repository has been bitten by repeatedly — **listing only
/// what was gated silently converts "ungated" into "unaffected"**. A PR whose
/// paths the candidate cares about can merge with nothing measured, and nothing
/// anywhere says so.
///
/// So a candidate carries a FULL [`GateCoverage`], exactly as a required gate
/// does, and [`promotion_debt`] joins it against changed paths. The telemetry
/// renders the result as an explicit debt row. No model is involved and none is
/// needed: it is a deterministic join between paths and records.
///
/// The first entry is `cross-contamination` (owner pattern: NOT_REQUIRED,
/// then promote once proven on release cuts). `memory-convergence` is the
/// next intended entry and cannot be listed until the benchmark exists — a
/// candidate naming an unregistered id would be a debt row nobody can ever
/// discharge, which is worse than no row.
/// `every_promotion_candidate_is_a_registered_benchmark` pins that.
///
/// ★ The list is the PIPELINE, not a parking lot: `concurrency-sweep` and
/// `decode-floor` both graduated to [`REQUIRED`] on 2026-08-15 once their
/// calibration preconditions were met (see the comments on their REQUIRED
/// entries). Their old candidate entries are gone from here because a gate
/// cannot be owed and excused at once — the test above pins that.
