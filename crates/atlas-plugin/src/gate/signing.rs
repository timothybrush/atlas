//! Ed25519 signatures binding a gate record to the commit it measured.
//!
//! # What this proves, and what it does not
//!
//! The identity is generated on the box, unprompted, so **a signature does not
//! prove who ran the campaign** — anyone can mint a keypair. Saying otherwise
//! would be the security theatre this module is trying to avoid.
//!
//! What it does prove is what the gate actually needs: every record in a pull
//! request was produced by ONE signer at ONE commit, and none was altered after
//! it was written. A record cannot be hand-edited, and it cannot be lifted from
//! one commit and presented as evidence for another — the commit sha is inside
//! the signed message, so re-pointing it invalidates the signature.
//!
//! The trust decision is deliberately moved to the one moment a human is already
//! looking: the FIRST time a fingerprint appears, it arrives as a one-line
//! addition under `.github/record-signers/`, in the diff, covered by the seal.
//! After that the box is silent forever and the operator never thinks about keys.
//!
//! # Why `ring`
//!
//! It is already in `Cargo.lock` (via `ureq` → `rustls`), so declaring it here
//! adds a dependency EDGE and zero packages — the constraint this design was
//! given. Ed25519 is compiled unconditionally, and `Apache-2.0 AND ISC` already
//! clears `deny.toml`'s allow-list.
