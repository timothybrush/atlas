//! # The outage these pin

//! Atlas squash-merges. A gate record is written on a PR branch against a
//! commit on that branch; the squash lands a NEW commit on main with a
//! different sha and no parent link back. Under the old
//! `merge-base --is-ancestor` guard, every record a PR paid GPU hours for
//! stopped covering anything the moment it merged.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical. `.benchmarks/*/2026-08-09-b0be4ba0e6.json` are
//! five real passing records for #389; after #389 squash-landed as `dd2ac46d5`
//! the gate reported "not an ancestor of this commit" for all five, main went
//! red, and every PR opened afterwards inherited a demand for five fresh GPU
//! legs.
//!
//! The rule now is content, not ancestry — the same lesson the kernel-lever
//! audits learned: never ask `merge-base --is-ancestor` of a repo that
//! squashes, diff the content instead.
