//! Benchmark groups: one gate satisfied by several runs.
//!
//! A group is a gate whose measurement is split across N member benchmarks that
//! can run on different boxes at the same time. The group id is what
//! `coverage::REQUIRED`, `BENCH.toml` and `pr-taxonomy.json` refer to; the
//! members are ordinary benchmarks that are NOT required in their own right.
//!
//! Keeping the group id equal to the old single-benchmark id is deliberate:
//! `bfcl-subset` stays `bfcl-subset`, so `REQUIRED` stays eleven entries, the
//! BENCH.toml thresholds are untouched, and every `_benches` reference keeps
//! resolving. Only the way the number is PRODUCED changes.
//!
//! # Why a group is not just "run them and average"
//!
//! Two rules make the difference between a group that means something and one
//! that quietly reports a different measurement:
//!
//! 1. **All or nothing.** A group with three of four members present is not
//!    75% measured, it is a DIFFERENT measurement — its aggregate is computed
//!    over a sample set the thresholds were never drawn against. A missing
//!    shard is a named failure, never a pass.
//! 2. **Aggregate over counts, never over scores.** See
//!    [`crate::benchmarks::bfcl::aggregate`] — `score.py` weights
//!    hierarchically, so a mean of member scores is not the whole-set value.
//!
//! Members may be signed by different boxes only because these are
//! `Sensitivity::Correctness` gates, which is measured, not assumed — see
//! [`super::agreement`].
//!
//! # ★ THE SPLIT IS NOT TRANSPARENT ON THE SHIPPED CONFIGURATION (#936)
//!
//! Everything below makes the ARITHMETIC of a group exact: the shards are a
//! partition, the tallies sum as integers, the hierarchy is applied once. None
//! of that makes the MEASUREMENT order-independent, and on the shipped serve it
//! is not. Measured 2026-09-08 at one commit, one model, temp 0, seed 42:
//!
//! | configuration | whole (995) vs its own 4 shards |
//! |---|---|
//! | shipped | **12 samples disagree** |
//! | `ATLAS_NO_TAIL_SPLIT=1` (snapshot producer off) | 4 |
//! | `ATLAS_MARCONI_MIN_TOKENS=1e8` (consumer off) | 2 |
//!
//! The cause is cross-request **SSM snapshot reuse**. A snapshot saved by one
//! request enters a shared, globally evicted pool (128 slots / 19392 MB on
//! GB10); a later request restores from whichever eligible anchor happens to
//! be there; restoring at a different depth gives numerically different SSM
//! state; at a near-tied argmax the emitted token flips. Sharding changes
//! eviction pressure because it changes run length, so it changes which anchor
//! a sample gets.
//!
//! The engine is bit-reproducible for a fixed request ORDER — two runs of the
//! same shard at the same commit were byte-identical — so this is entirely an
//! ordering effect, not run-to-run noise.
//!
//! **What this means for anyone extending this module.** A group's aggregate is
//! exact with respect to its members, and its members are not guaranteed to
//! reproduce the serial run they stand in for. Do not read a passing group as
//! evidence that sharding is transparent; that is a separate claim needing its
//! own measurement, and #936 records it failing by 12 of 995 while the score
//! cleared its floor by 0.04 and ran 0.76 low.
//!
//! **CLOSED 2026-09-10 (#981), and by a different knob than this note first
//! predicted.** The shipped mechanism is `--hermetic`, not `ssm_cache_slots =
//! "0"`: the latter closes the SSM snapshot producer only, and measured 4 of
//! 995 — better, not zero. The residual channel was the radix KV prefix cache,
//! which has no session key at all. `--hermetic` closes both and gates every
//! snapshot entry by session, and reaches **0 of 995** — whole draw against its
//! own four shards, byte-exact per `sample_id`, reproduced on two boxes against
//! a base arm of 12 of 995 at the same commit.
//!
//! The floors did NOT need re-cutting, which this note also predicted wrongly.
//! Equality does cost score — the whole leg reads 84.22 / 84.12 open and
//! 83.92 / 84.22 closed — but both clear the committed bars, so the bars stand
//! and the regime change is carried by the UI's like-for-like band instead.
