//! Do the records a PR ADDS agree with each other?
//!
//! Each record is already bound to a commit by its signature. This binds them
//! to *each other*: without it a PR can present a favourable record measured at
//! one commit beside another measured at a different commit, each individually
//! valid and signed.
//!
//! # Why signer agreement is per metric class
//!
//! The rule used to be blanket — "One campaign, one box, one identity" — and it
//! cost a night. A campaign split across three boxes to save wall-clock produced
//! a record set spanning three signing keys (the key is
//! `<ATLAS_HOME>/identity/ed25519.pk8`, so it is per ATLAS_HOME, not per
//! machine; one box had two). CI rejected the lot and seven gates were
//! re-measured on one box.
//!
//! The blanket rule is right for half the suite and wrong for the other half,
//! and `Sensitivity` already draws exactly that line:
//!
//! * `Sensitivity::Speed` — "thermally corruptible". Boxes genuinely differ by
//!   far more than their own run-to-run noise. Measured 2026-09-06 on one gate
//!   at one commit: dgx2 mean 22.78 tok/s (sigma 0.063, n=10), dgx3 mean 23.44
//!   (sigma 0.070, n=10). A 0.66 tok/s gap, ten times either box's sigma. A
//!   floor drawn on one box does not describe another, so these records must
//!   come from ONE box.
//! * `Sensitivity::Correctness` — "accuracy, fidelity, state integrity". The
//!   same BFCL gate measured independently on dgx1 and dgx2 at sha 82552fe34d
//!   returned byte-identical scores: overall 86.55, normalized 86.95, n=1004.
//!   Nothing about the box enters the number, so spanning boxes is sound — and
//!   it is what lets a sharded gate run four ways at once.
//!
//! Every signer must still be committed in `.github/record-signers/`; this
//! relaxes WHICH keys may appear together, never whether a key is vouched for.
