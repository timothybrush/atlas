//! The open-PR telemetry view: one comment, rewritten in place.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Each PR's own checks answer "is this one green?". Nothing answers "are these
//! seven green *together*" — two PRs touching one kernel target are each
//! measured against a baseline neither will hold once the other lands. This
//! renders the cross-PR view: which targets each PR re-opens, where they
//! collide, and an order that lands them without a collision.
//!
//! # Rendering is separate from fetching on purpose
//!
//! [`render`] is a pure function of [`PrFacts`] plus the tree. Everything that
//! talks to GitHub lives in the workflow, so the part with the judgement in it —
//! which targets, which order, who to mention — is unit-testable without a
//! network, a token, or a fixture repository.
//!
//! # It advises; it does not block
//!
//! Nothing here fails a check. A collision is a note for whoever merges, and the
//! CODEOWNERS mentions are a courtesy. The blocking decisions stay in
//! `check.rs`, where they are made against committed records rather than
//! against a model's or a heuristic's opinion.
