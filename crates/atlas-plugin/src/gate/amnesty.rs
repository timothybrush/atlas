//! Content-pinned amnesty for a boundary-policy bootstrap.
//!
//! # The grant
//!
//! There is no current grant. Two have completed the full lifecycle here —
//! pinned, re-earned, emptied: PR #701's three coverage-policy boundary files,
//! and PR #648's KV-budget accounting fix
//! (`crates/spark-model/src/factory/build.rs`, blob
//! `01068a74c5068fb65b25b044d7580df3b36e39ed`).
//!
//! #648's grant was emptied when every required gate had a record newer than
//! `AMNESTY_EPOCH` — the ten taken at `0c402bac00` for #754 — which is exactly
//! the condition `amnesty_expires_once_every_gate_has_a_fresh_record` exists to
//! detect, and it detected it. The machinery below stays because the next
//! bootstrap should not have to re-derive it, and an empty table is fail-closed
//! by construction: every lookup falls through to "not excused".
//!
//! A grant covers only the final reviewed blobs of the listed files. It is
//! the same mechanism accepted for the 2026-08-16 governance bootstrap:
//! a table anyone can read, a pin no later edit can inherit, and a test that
//! demands removal after all ten records have been re-earned.
//!
//! # Why content-pinned rather than waived
//!
//! Each entry pins the exact blob OID this PR lands. `git rev-parse <head>:<path>`
//! names the CONTENT of the file at the commit being checked,
//! so the grant covers precisely the reviewed bytes: the moment anyone edits
//! either file again, the OID changes and invalidation applies exactly as
//! before. There is no time window and no path-level waiver to inherit —
//! a second edit to the taxonomy pays full price, as it should.
//!
//! # Fail-closed
//!
//! Every uncertainty is "not excused": a path not in the table, git missing
//! or failing, an unknown commit, the path absent at `head`, output that is
//! not a 40-hex OID, an OID that is not the pinned one. A false "not excused"
//! costs a re-run; a false "excused" would be a shipped regression behind a
//! green gate — the same asymmetry the rest of the gate is built on.
//!
//! # Residual risk, stated plainly
//!
//! This file cannot itself be in `BOUNDARY_FILES` without circularity: its
//! own landing would then invalidate everything it exists to protect. It is
//! covered only by `GATE_MACHINERY`'s cargo-test rationale, like the rest of
//! the gate bookkeeping. Compensations: the table's exact contents are pinned
//! by `the_table_is_exactly_the_pr_648_grant` (paths, OID format, grant
//! text), every application is logged loudly by `check.rs`, CODEOWNERS
//! review covers the gate directory, and the gate already executes
//! PR-checkout code — so this adds no new attack class, only a reviewed
//! single-file exception to one rule.
//!
//! # Removal condition
//!
//! EMPTY THE TABLE once every required gate has a record newer than
//! `AMNESTY_EPOCH`. At that point the grant protects nothing because every
//! record postdates the grant day and was earned against the amnestied
//! content. `amnesty_expires_once_every_gate_has_a_fresh_record` fails with
//! instructions when that day arrives, so the table cannot quietly outlive
//! its purpose.
