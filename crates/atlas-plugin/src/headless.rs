//! Driving a benchmark without a terminal.
//!
//! The dashboard pumps a run from its render tick. A script has no tick, so
//! this is the same pump as a blocking call: start, drain until finished,
//! record. Both paths end at [`crate::history::save`], so a run means the same
//! thing and lands in the same place however it was started.
//!
//! Lives here rather than in the server because this crate has no GPU
//! dependency — the whole loop is exercised against a mock endpoint in
//! `cargo test -p atlas-plugin`, on any machine.
