//! [`TierEvict`] — what an SSM spill-tier eviction decided to do with the
//! victim. Split out of `prefix_cache.rs` (500-LoC cap).

/// Outcome of [`crate::prefix_cache::PrefixCache::evict_snapshot_to_tier`].
///
/// The spill side of the tier has a cost gate (`AVAROK_SSM_SPILL_MIN_TOKENS`)
/// mirroring the fault-in side's `AVAROK_SSM_FAULT_MIN_TOKENS`, and the gate has
/// to be applied at VICTIM SELECTION, not at the byte move. Gating only the
/// byte move would leave the index entry marked `tiered` — findable by
/// `lookup_tiered` — with no blob behind it, so every warm turn would pay a
/// full-blob allocation plus a `store.get` only to learn it misses.
///
/// Both arms free the victim's HBM slot, so the caller's invariant "a reclaim
/// always yields a slot" is preserved either way.
