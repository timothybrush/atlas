//! Detect a destroyed CUDA context after a failed GPU operation (issue #429).
//!
//! This is the one place that turns a driver failure into the process-wide
//! verdict held by [`avarok_core::fault`]. The decision itself is that module's
//! pure [`classify`](avarok_core::fault::classify); everything here is the
//! probe it needs.
//!
//! # The probe
//!
//! `cuStreamSynchronize` on the legacy default stream. On a healthy context
//! with no outstanding work this returns `CUDA_SUCCESS` immediately; on a
//! context destroyed by a sticky error it returns that error, and keeps
//! returning it forever. It is therefore a direct measurement of "is this
//! context still usable", which is exactly the question — and not a guess from
//! the failing call's status code.
//!
//! Synchronizing is also what surfaces *asynchronous* faults. A misaligned
//! access inside a kernel does not fail the launch; it faults the context
//! later, and the next synchronizing call is what reports it. Probing with a
//! sync is what lets an async fault be attributed at all.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! One sync, and only on an error path. Once the latch is set the probe is
//! skipped entirely, so a dead context does not pay a sync per doomed call.
