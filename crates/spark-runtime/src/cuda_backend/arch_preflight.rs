//! Refuse to load kernels the GPU cannot run, BEFORE the driver does it badly.
//!
//! Atlas compiles one SM architecture per build, and the driver's answer to a
//! mismatch is `CUDA_ERROR_NO_BINARY_FOR_GPU` (or
//! `CUDA_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_PTX_VERSION`) raised inside `cuModuleLoadData` — an
//! error that names neither the arch in the binary nor the card in the box. An
//! operator who boots the published gb10 image on an H100 gets that, and
//! nothing to act on.
//!
//! So this runs first: two `cuDeviceGetAttribute` calls, the pure rule from
//! [`atlas_core::arch`], and a message that names both sides. The rule itself
//! lives in atlas-core because `--check-kernels` reports it too.
//!
//! The capability query is addressed BY ORDINAL (`cuDeviceGet`), not by "the
//! calling thread's current context" (`cuCtxGetDevice`). That is not a style
//! preference — see [`device_compute_capability_of`]. `cuDeviceGetAttribute`
//! and `cuCtxGetDevice` were already declared for the SM-count query;
//! `cuDeviceGet` is the one addition, alongside them.
