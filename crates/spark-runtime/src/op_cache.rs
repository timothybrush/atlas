//! [`OpCache`] — per-backend kernel handles and scratch buffers.
//!
//! Kernel-launching ops memoize two things: the [`KernelHandle`] they resolve
//! from the module registry, and any device scratch they grow on demand. Both
//! were being cached in function-local `static OnceLock` / `static Mutex`, and
//! both are **owned by the model**:
//!
//! * A `KernelHandle` is a raw `CUfunction` from an `AvarokRegistry` module.
//!   The registry unloads its modules on drop, so a handle cached in a static
//!   outlives the module it points into — a launch after a swap is a
//!   use-after-unload, not a stale value.
//! * A scratch `DevicePtr` is an allocation in the model's context. Cached in
//!   a static, the next model writes its activations through a pointer that
//!   was freed with the previous one.
//!
//! Neither fails loudly. Both are the kind of defect that surfaces as
//! corrupted output or an illegal address in an unrelated kernel.
//!
//! An `OpCache` lives on the backend, so its lifetime is exactly the model's:
//! when the backend drops, the handles go with the registry that owns them and
//! the scratch goes with the context that allocated it.
