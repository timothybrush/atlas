//! Run mailboxes — the observability surfaces that stay process-global on
//! purpose, and the one call that keeps them honest across a model swap.
//!
//! Most model-derived state in Atlas is carried: `SchedCtx`, `ForwardContext`,
//! `ModelLevers`, `OpCache`. A handful of counters cannot be, because their
//! *readers* cannot be handed a carrier — `/metrics` answers from an HTTP
//! handler thread and the dashboard polls from the TUI thread, both while the
//! scheduler is mid-step and holding its own context. A process-global address
//! is what an observability surface is for.
//!
//! That leaves the scoping problem: after a swap the counters would describe
//! two models at once. [`reset_for_new_run`] solves it from the other end —
//! the values stay reachable at a fixed address, but they start clean when a
//! run does, so a reader asking "what is the prefix-cache hit rate" gets the
//! rate for the model now running. Prometheus reads the reset as a counter
//! restart, which it already handles.
//!
//! Called from `AvarokCudaBackend::new`, which is where a model's GPU state
//! begins. That is deliberately upstream of the first kernel lookup, so the
//! kernel audit records only this model's modules.
