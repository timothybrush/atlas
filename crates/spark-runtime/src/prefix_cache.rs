//! Prefix caching trait for KV block reuse (SDD).
//!
//! When multiple requests share a common prompt prefix, previously-computed
//! KV cache blocks can be reused instead of re-running prefill. The cache
//! is indexed by token sequences at block granularity via a radix tree.
//!
//! Two implementations:
//! - `NoPrefixCaching`: no-ops (zero overhead when disabled)
//! - `RadixTree` (see `crate::radix_tree`): full radix tree with LRU eviction
