//! avarok-rdma: the one-sided RDMA verbs primitive shared by every Atlas RDMA
//! tier (experts / KV overflow / weight staging / LoRA / SSM snapshots).
//!
//! The C shim's QP/RTR/RTS attribute constants and the handshake wire codecs
//! are a frozen external contract: they must stay byte-compatible with already
//! deployed peers, so the shim is treated as byte-stable.
//!
//! CUDA-free by hard constraint (see Cargo.toml): both the non-CUDA peer
//! daemons and the CUDA client tiers link this.
//!
//! `cfg(avarok_rdma_verbs)` is decided by build.rs — ON when `target_os` is not
//! macOS and `AVAROK_SKIP_BUILD`/`SKIP_AVAROK_BUILD` is unset (there is no
//! rdma-core probe; if the headers are missing there, `cc` fails the build
//! loudly) — and published to direct dependents via the `links` metadata
//! `DEP_AVAROK_RDMA_SHIM_HAS_VERBS`. See build.rs for the full story.
