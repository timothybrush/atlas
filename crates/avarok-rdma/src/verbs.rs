// Safe-ish Rust wrapper over the one-sided RDMA READ C-shim (`rdma_shim.c`).
// Compiled only where the shim is (`cfg(avarok_rdma_verbs)`, emitted by build.rs
// on Linux with rdma-core). Deliberately CUDA-free: the peer server (non-cuda)
// registers its store here, the client tier (cuda) registers its pinned arena.
//
// One `Verbs` == one RC QP + its device context. The QP-identity exchange
// (qpn/psn/gid) rides the TCP control channel; `connect` drives INIT->RTR->RTS.
// The client posts `IBV_WR_RDMA_READ`s with `post_read` and reaps them with
// `poll` (blocking busy-poll); the server QP only reaches RTS to respond, its
// CPU idle (the point of one-sided reads).
