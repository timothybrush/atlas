//! Is one kernel directory a faithful symlink mirror of another, apart from

//!
//! Shared by `tests/inherited_targets.rs`, which asks it of every hardware set
//! that inherits `kernels/gb10`'s kernels rather than shipping its own. Lives
//! under `tests/support/` so cargo does not also pick it up as a test target
//! of its own — a subdirectory is not auto-discovered, a `tests/*.rs` is — and

//!
//! Maintainer rule, 2026-09-11 (tbraun96): "symlinks are fine provided the
//! pointed-to gb10 file is not edited when iterating on Hopper; Hopper-tuned
//! kernels must be real files under `kernels/hopper/`." So the mirror is no
//! longer a pure bijection: a target may carry sources the oracle does not
//! have, for hardware whose tuning has nothing to do with GB10.
//!
//! They are DECLARED, in `kernels/<hw>/HARDWARE.toml` `[kernels] overrides`,
//! and not merely tolerated. An undeclared regular file in a mirror is a
//! silent fork of a shared kernel — the exact defect this checker exists to
//! catch — and nothing on disk distinguishes the two cases.

/// A mirror is correct when:
///
/// * every entry the `origin` has, it has, as a RELATIVE symlink that resolves
///   — an entry the origin has and the mirror does not is a kernel that
///   vanishes from this hardware's build, and a link that does not resolve is
///   a compile error deferred to whoever next owns a GPU;
/// * every entry it has that the origin does not is DECLARED in `overrides` —
///   an undeclared one is a fork nobody announced;
/// * every declared override is present and resolves, and does NOT resolve to
///   the origin's file of the same name — an "override" that is a link back to
///   the file it claims to replace is a declaration that lies. (It may be a
///   regular file, which is what the rule asks for on the tuned target, or a
///   relative symlink to ANOTHER target's override, which is how a second
///   architecture shares one tuned source without making a duplicate copy.)
///
/// `owned` is the DECLARED exception: entry names this hardware set tunes for
/// itself, where a real file REPLACES the link (maintainer rule, 2026-09-11 —
/// a Hopper-tuned kernel overrides its gb10 namesake and must not edit it).
/// Each name is required to be present and required to be a regular file, and
/// is permitted — only there — to have no counterpart in `origin`, which is
/// how a tuned kernel brings its own header. Everything about the exception is
/// checked: a name listed here that is still a symlink is a dead declaration,
/// and a name NOT listed here that has become a regular file is still the
/// silent fork this checker exists to catch.
///
/// Returns the empty vec when the mirror is sound. Kept as a function rather
