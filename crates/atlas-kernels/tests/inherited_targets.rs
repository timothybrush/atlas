//! The hardware targets that INHERIT `kernels/gb10`'s kernels instead of
//! shipping their own — `kernels/hopper` (H100/H200, sm_90a) and
//! `kernels/b200` (B200/GB200, sm_100a) — pinned against the REAL tree.
//!
//! Same posture as `target_resolution.rs`: `src/*_tests.rs` prove the rules on
//! fixtures, these prove the DATA that is actually checked in.
//!
//! Neither target ships a kernel of its own today. Every source they compile
//! is a relative symlink into `kernels/gb10`, which makes `gb10` the ORACLE
//! for this whole file: an inherited kernel set is correct exactly when it is
//! gb10's kernel set, reachable, plus whatever the target DECLARES it owns. A
//! symlink that dangles, a gb10 file that gained no counterpart, or a fork
//! nobody declared is a kernel that silently vanishes from — or silently
//! diverges in — that hardware's build: the shadow-drift failure class
//! documented in `build.rs`, arriving through a different door.
//!
//! The exception is DECLARED, per target, in `HARDWARE.toml` `[kernels]
//! overrides` — the SSOT, read here through
//! [`inherited::Inherited::owned`] and by
//! `scripts/check_kernel_shadows.py`. Maintainer rule, 2026-09-11 (tbraun96):
//! "symlinks are fine provided the pointed-to gb10 file is not edited when
//! iterating on Hopper; Hopper-tuned kernels must be real files under
//! `kernels/hopper/`." Declared rather than merely tolerated, because an
//! UNDECLARED regular file in a mirror is a silent fork of a shared kernel and
//! nothing on disk tells the two apart. Both lists are EMPTY on this tip; the
//! mechanism is what a tuned-kernel PR declares into.
//!
//! `cargo test` runs GPU-free with `ATLAS_SKIP_BUILD=1`, where `build.rs`
//! returns before target resolution ever happens, so without this file nothing
//! in CI looks at either tree at all.
//!
//! PARAMETRISED over [`INHERITED`] rather than duplicated per hardware set:
//! the second target arrived by copying the first, and two copies of an
//! assertion drift the moment one is updated. Each test names the hardware set
//! in its failure message, so a red still says which tree is wrong.
//!
//! This binary covers the tree AS MIRRORED — HARDWARE.toml, `common/`, the P0
//! MODEL.tomls, and what `build.rs` would resolve. The `ATLAS_NO_WARP_
//! BLOCKSCALE_MMA` opt-out and the `[expected_absent]` pins that answer it are
//! `inherited_targets_w4a4.rs`; both read [`INHERITED`] from
//! `support/inherited.rs`, so neither can be told about a target the other has
//! not heard of.
