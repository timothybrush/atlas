//! The SERVING defaults baked from the compiled target's
//! `kernels/<hw>/HARDWARE.toml` `[defaults]` table.
//!
//! # Why this is code and not a launch script
//!
//! Maintainer review, 2026-09-11 (tbraun96), on the H100 integration branch:
//!
//! > There is no arch separation at all. H100 builds compile GB10's kernel
//! > tree. Every Hopper/GB10 divergence is expressed as an env lever set by an
//! > H100 recipe living outside this repo — not as arch-selected code. "No
//! > interference" rests on discipline rather than structure.
//!
//! Each field below was a line in that external recipe. Baking them from the
//! target's own HARDWARE.toml makes the recipe STRUCTURAL: `build.rs` reads
//! exactly one `kernels/<hw>` tree, so a binary built for GB10 cannot carry
//! Hopper's numbers, and an H100 serve with an empty environment reproduces
//! the measured configuration without anyone remembering a prefix.
//!
//! # The rule every consumer follows
//!
//! **Baked default first, environment second.** The environment is an
//! EXPLICIT operator override, not the source of truth, and `spark-server`
//! logs one `target defaults (<hw>): …` line naming every resolved value and
//! which of them came from the environment. See
//! `spark_model::layers::ops::target_defaults` for the resolvers and the
//! override grammar.
//!
//! # Adding a lever — four places, one commit
//!
//! A lever row is: the field here, the parse arm in `build_defaults.rs`, the
//! resolver field in `spark_model::layers::ops::target_defaults`, and the row
//! in EVERY `kernels/<hw>/HARDWARE.toml` that has a `[defaults]` table — plus
//! the boot line and a test, which the resolver and
//! `tests/target_defaults.rs` already force. All in ONE commit.
//!
//! ★ THE CONTRACT IS ALSO A SCOPE RULE. A row belongs in the commit that
//! lands its CONSUMER, not in the commit that builds this table. A row whose
//! dispatch site does not exist yet is a declaration nothing reads: it cannot
//! be graded, an operator who sets its variable gets silence, and the `(env)`
//! tag in the boot line would report a decision that changes no code. So a
//! kernel PR adds its own row here, in `build_defaults.rs`, in the resolver
//! and in all three tables, together with the arm that reads it.
//!
//! `parse_defaults` panics on an unknown `[defaults]` key, so a table that
//! names a lever the code does not have fails the build instead of reading as
//! agreement — which is what makes "one commit" enforceable rather than
//! merely asked for.
