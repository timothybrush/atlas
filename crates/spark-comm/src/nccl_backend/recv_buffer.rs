//! Capacity invariant for the 2-rank send/recv all-reduce receive buffer.
//!
//! At `world_size == 2` the all-reduce is not `ncclAllReduce` (which reduces
//! in-place and needs no scratch): it is a paired `ncclSend`/`ncclRecv` into a
//! persistent receive buffer, followed by a local add. That buffer is the only
//! place in the collective path where a payload is written into an allocation
//! it did not come from — so it is the only place that can overrun.
//!
//! The invariant this module exists to hold:
//!
//! > **`payload_bytes <= recv_capacity_bytes`, always.**
//!
//! and the capacity is **derived from the configured maximum transfer**, never
//! assumed. A fixed constant here previously coexisted with a unit test that
//! modelled a 4096-token prefill chunk while the shipped default was 8192; the
//! test passed and bounded nothing. *A constant plus a stale assumption is not
//! a guard.*
