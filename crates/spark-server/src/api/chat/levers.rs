//! [`ChatLevers`] — the chat request path's model- and deployment-scoped
//! switches, resolved once when the server is built and carried on
//! [`crate::AppState`].
//!
//! Each of these was a private `OnceLock<bool>` beside its one or two call
//! sites. Individually harmless; collectively they are the reason the request
//! path could not be exercised in a test without mutating the process
//! environment, and the reason a second model loaded into a live process would
//! inherit the first one's configuration.
//!
//! Grouped rather than added to `AppState` one field at a time so the request
//! path has a single, greppable answer to "what can vary here", and so the
//! renderer can be handed [`PromptLevers`] alone — the narrow sub-struct it
//! actually needs — instead of the whole server state.
