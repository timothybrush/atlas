//! MoE quality interventions: LASER routing rebalance + MoE-Spec
//! verification-time expert budgeting (B.5, 2026-04-25).
//!
//! References:
//!  - LASER: arXiv:2510.03293 — score-distribution-aware top-k
//!    expansion. Sharply skewed routing layers stay top-k; flat
//!    layers expand to least-loaded experts. Reduces expert
//!    imbalance ~48% at <0.02 accuracy loss on Mixtral / DeepSeek-MoE.
//!  - MoE-Spec: arXiv:2602.16052 — verification-time expert budgeting:
//!    cap experts loaded per layer to top contributors, drop the
//!    long tail.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Atlas's actual MoE forward kernel lives in `avarok-kernels`, not
//! here. This module ships the **policy primitives** that decide:
//!
//!   1. Given a router's softmax distribution and the configured
//!      top-k, should we expand to a wider set of experts? (LASER)
//!   2. Given a list of expert indices and their per-token weights,
//!      what's the minimal subset whose combined weight covers
//!      `coverage` of the total? (MoE-Spec budgeting)
//!
//! Production wiring requires the kernel to call these helpers
//! before the expert dispatch and respect the returned subsets.

/// Compute Shannon entropy of a router distribution. Used by LASER
/// to decide whether the layer is "sharply skewed" (low entropy →
/// stay top-k) or "flat" (high entropy → expand the candidate pool).
///
/// `scores` is the softmax output (probabilities summing to ~1).

/// LASER top-k expansion decision. Returns the number of experts to
/// route to:
///   - When entropy is below `entropy_threshold`, return the original
///     top-k (sharply skewed → stay tight).
///   - When entropy is above the threshold, return `top_k_expanded`
///     (flat → widen the pool to balance load).
///
/// Recommended threshold (per LASER paper): 0.7 * log(num_experts).
