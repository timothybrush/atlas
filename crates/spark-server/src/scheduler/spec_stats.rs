//! Run telemetry — speculation acceptance and decode timing.
//!
//! Nineteen `AtomicU64` statics across `verify_k2_step`, `verify_k3_step` and
//! `verify_k4_step` counted draft acceptance and per-position draft matches,
//! and periodically logged a summary. They are model-scoped in the way that
//! matters for a diagnostic: acceptance rate is a property of *a* model's
//! drafter against *a* model's verifier. Accumulated in process globals they
//! would blend two models' rates after a swap, and the periodic summary would
//! report a number that describes neither.
//!
//! Nothing here changes generation, so a stale count is not wrong output — it
//! is a wrong *measurement*, which for telemetry is the same kind of failure.
//!
//! Kept as atomics because the counters are genuinely mutated from the decode
//! path through a shared `&SchedCtx`; the change is that they live inside the
//! run rather than the process.
