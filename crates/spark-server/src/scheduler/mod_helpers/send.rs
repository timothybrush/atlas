/// Why this exists: `emit_token` and its siblings run ON the scheduler thread,

/// unbounded `tx.blocking_send`, so ONE stalled SSE consumer (channel full =
/// 1024 undelivered events) froze the entire engine — all concurrent
/// sequences, prefill and decode alike — for as long as that client stayed
/// wedged. At C=1 that stalls one user's own request; at C=16 it is a
/// denial-of-service pivot. There were TWELVE direct `blocking_send` call
/// sites scattered across the scheduler, so the bound lives here once.
///
/// Semantics: identical to the old path until the deadline — try, then poll
/// the full channel at 1 ms — after which the send is abandoned and `false` is
/// returned, which every caller already treats exactly like the
/// receiver-dropped case (finish/cancel that sequence). A consumer that is
/// both 1024 events behind AND unresponsive for the whole deadline is
/// indistinguishable from a dead one; delivering its backlog later cannot
/// matter.
