//! Behavioural tests for the stray-`</think>` watchdog on the MTP /
//! spec-verify path (`emit_step::emit_token`).
//!
//! The watchdog exists for one documented degeneration: at long context
//! the model repeats `</think>` forever. That failure is CONSECUTIVE by
//! definition, and the non-MTP twin (`decode_logits_step.rs`) counts it
//! that way — it zeroes `think_skip_count` on every real content token.
//! `emit_token` had the increment and the `>= 50` threshold but no
//! reset, so on the MTP path the counter was CUMULATIVE: 50 SCATTERED
//! strays spread across otherwise healthy content force-stopped the
//! response, while the identical token stream on the non-MTP path ran
//! to completion.
//!
//! These tests drive the real `emit_token` over a real `ActiveSeq` — no
//! re-implementation of the predicate — and pin both halves:
//!  * scattered strays must NOT stop the turn, however many there are;
//!  * a consecutive run of 50 must STILL stop it, so the bug cannot be
//!    "fixed" by defanging the watchdog.
