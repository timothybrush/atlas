//! Verify-time argmax with the sampler's first-index-wins tie-break.
//!
//! Split out of `verify_pipeline_helper.rs`, which is over the 500 LoC cap.

/// Argmax with the sampler's exact tie-break: strict `>` scanning forward, so
/// the FIRST index holding the maximum wins.
///
/// Replaces the obvious single loop
/// `for (i, &v) { if v > best_val { best_val = v; best_id = i } }`,
/// which carries a loop dependency through BOTH the running value and the
/// running index. That blocks vectorisation and leaves one long dependency
/// chain: measured 1.19 ms per verify step for 4 x 248k f32 (~840 MB/s, far
/// under memory bandwidth) and 70% of the whole host logits pipeline
/// (`AVAROK_MTP_TIMING`, K=4, 150 steps).
///
/// Two passes instead:
///   1. max only, over 8 independent accumulators — no index dependency, so
///      the chains are independent and the compiler is free to widen them;
///   2. the first index equal to that max, which typically exits early.
///
/// ## Why this is bit-identical, including the awkward cases
/// The original loop's final `best_val` IS the maximum, and because the test is
/// strictly `>`, `best_id` is the FIRST index attaining it. So "max, then first
/// index equal to max" is the same answer, provided the edge cases agree:
///
/// * **NaN** — `v > best` is false for NaN in both passes, so a NaN never
///   becomes the max in either form. If EVERY entry is NaN, the original leaves
///   `best_val = -inf` / `best_id = 0`; here pass 1 also leaves `-inf`, pass 2
///   finds no `v == -inf` (NaN compares unequal) and falls back to 0. Same.
/// * **-0.0 vs +0.0** — IEEE says they are equal, so neither `>` nor `==`
///   distinguishes them. Whichever zero appears FIRST is the one the original
///   latches, and pass 2's `==` matches at that same first index. Same.
///
/// Deliberately NOT `f32::max`: that returns the non-NaN operand, which would
/// let a NaN-adjacent value win where the original `>` ignored it.
