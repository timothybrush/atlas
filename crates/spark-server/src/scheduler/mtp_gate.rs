//! Throughput-arbitrated MTP runtime gate.
//!
//! Chooses between MTP speculative decode and plain serial decode by
//! comparing DELIVERED throughput (emitted tokens / wall) measured over
//! whole step windows in each mode — never by comparing component step
//! timings. The previous gate compared `verify_wall / decode_wall` against
//! expected accepted tokens; on the 35B MoE that arithmetic disabled MTP
//! (multiplier 2.07–2.23 ≥ effective 1.75–2.0) while an always-on control
//! measured 18% FASTER end-to-end decode (webserver_ok A/B, 2026-07-20:
//! Σ1028s/10-10 always-on vs Σ1846s/9-10 gated). Component walls miss
//! per-token costs outside the timed step and amortization effects, so the
//! arbiter now measures exactly the quantity being optimized.
//!
//! Policy (bandit-style greedy with scheduled exploration — cf. TapOut
//! arXiv:2511.02017, GammaTune-style hysteresis):
//! - Run the currently-faster mode; accumulate (tokens, wall) into a
//!   fixed-size step window; on window close update that mode's tok/s EWMA
//!   and a deviation EWMA.
//! - Switch modes only when the other mode's EWMA is faster by more than a
//!   noise margin (hysteresis) for [`SWITCH_DWELL_WINDOWS`] consecutive
//!   windows — the old gate flipped ENABLED→DISABLED within 6s on
//!   measurement noise (multiplier 1.35→1.78), each flip costing a
//!   draft-head resync.
//! - While in Serial, re-probe MTP after [`reprobe_tokens`] emitted tokens.
//!   While in Mtp, refresh the serial baseline after
//!   [`serial_refresh_tokens`] (one window ≈ ≤0.3% overhead bound).
//! - A depth-regime change (factor [`REMEASURE_DEPTH_FACTOR`] = 2, floor
//!   [`REMEASURE_DEPTH_FLOOR`] = 512) marks both baselines stale and
//!   pulls the next probe forward (one [`WINDOW_STEPS`] window). A stale
//!   other-mode EWMA cannot win a switch. This is the shipped gate
//!   (#337 / #344 / #242 / d6171c4), not a second gate.
//! - Steps are BATCH steps: a plain decode step over n active sequences
//!   emits n tokens and is charged as n (2026-08-15 fix — it was charged as
//!   1, under-reading the serial EWMA ~n× at batch n while the verify side
//!   was already multi-seq summed, which made DisableMtp unreachable under
//!   concurrency). Tokens/sec at different batch widths are different
//!   economies, so EWMAs never compare across width regimes: a change of
//!   power-of-two width bucket discards the partial window, marks both
//!   baselines stale and pulls the next probe forward — the same policy as
//!   a depth-regime change.
//!
//! `AVAROK_MTP_GATE_FORCE=1` (existing) bypasses the gate entirely.
