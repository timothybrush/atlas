//! DFlash GAMMA RESOLVER: the per-step verify width for a block-diffusion
//! drafter, chosen by CONCURRENCY and, single-stream, by WORKLOAD.
//!
//! Measured on Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 + DFlash-2 (block 8), one Spark, 2026-09-03:
//!
//! | C     | prose (Volvo)        | code (MinHeap)        |
//! |-------|----------------------|-----------------------|
//! | 1     | γ5 27.0 / γ10 24.6   | γ10 66.8 / γ4 ~23     |
//! | 16    | γ4 187.7 / γ5 119.5  | γ4 269.7 / γ10 214.2  |
//!
//! Two facts fall out. (1) At C>=2 the K=4 write-on-accept verify wins BOTH
//! workloads: the state is read once and written once per step, and that
//! kernel exists only for K=4. (2) At C=1 the verify pass is a fixed cost, so
//! the width should track how many drafts the target will accept: code
//! accepts ~7.6 of 9 (p1 0.97) and wants the full block; prose accepts ~1.7
//! of 9 (p1 0.76) and wants a narrow block. `p1` (first-draft accept) is the
//! signal: it is bimodal, independent of the width, and free.
//!
//! The width is a DRAFT COUNT handed to the drafter per propose; the head runs
//! that many block rows (never more than it was sized for) and the verify
//! graphs on both sides are keyed by width, so after each width's first
//! capture a switch costs nothing. Sticky with hysteresis and a dwell, never
//! per step.
//!
//! Pinned (no resolver) when the operator passes `--dflash-gamma` explicitly
//! (a record run is a fixed configuration with a reproduction key) or sets
//! `AVAROK_DFLASH_STATIC_GAMMA` (presence). `AVAROK_DFLASH_GAMMA_RESOLVER`
//! (presence) turns it on even under an explicit flag, which then acts as the
//! cap. On the record: a resolved single-stream run is NOT reproducible by
//! any fixed-gamma run once it switches mid-stream; records stay per fixed
//! config.
//!
//! The trigger is an EXACT 64-step window, not a smoothed average: one bit per
//! verify step (first draft accepted or not) in a shift register, decided on
//! the popcount. A 10-step EWMA of a 0.76 process has sigma ~0.10 and brushed
//! the enter line about once per hundred steps (measured 2026-09-03: a flip
//! up and, one dwell later, a flip back, inside a single prose request).
//! Sized by simulation (300 seeds x 2000 steps per cell): at 60/55 of 64 with
//! a 64-step dwell, steady prose (0.76) flips 0.11 times per 2000 steps and
//! steady code (0.97) 0.01; a real transition flips once, ~65 steps after it
//! (~8 s at C=1). A 32-bit register at 29/27 was tried first and flipped 12.8
//! times per 2000 prose steps: the tails of Bin(32, 0.76) are fat.
//!
//! Overrides (tuning, all optional): `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_MULTI` (K at C>=2,
//! default 4), `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_NARROW` (C=1 prose K, default 5),
//! `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_WIDE` (C=1 code K, default = cap), `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_ENTER`
//! (window hits at/above which C=1 goes wide, 60), `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_LEAVE`
//! (hits at/below which it goes narrow, 55), `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_DWELL` (min
//! steps between switches, 64 = one full window).
