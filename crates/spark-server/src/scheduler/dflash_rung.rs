//! DFlash GAMMA RESOLVER: the per-step verify width for a block-diffusion
//! drafter, chosen by CONCURRENCY and, single-stream, by WORKLOAD.
//!
//! Measured on Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 + DFlash-2 (block 8), one Spark, 2026-09-03:
//!
//! | C     | prose (Volvo)        | code (MinHeap)        |
//! |-------|----------------------|-----------------------|
//! | 1     | γ5 27.0 / γ10 24.6   | γ10 66.8 / γ4 ~23     |
//! | 16    | γ4 180.7 / γ5 119.5  | γ4 279.5 / γ10 214.2  |
//!
//! Two facts fall out. (1) At C>=2 the K=4 write-on-accept verify wins BOTH
//! workloads: the state is read once and written once per step, and that
//! kernel exists only for K=4. (2) At C=1 the verify pass is a fixed cost, so
//! the width should track how many drafts the target will accept: code
//! accepts ~7.6 of 9 and wants the full block; prose accepts ~1.7 of 9 and
//! wants a narrow block. `p1` (first-draft accept) is the signal: it is
//! bimodal and free. It is NOT independent of the width: measured at C=1 on
//! 2026-09-04 (MinHeap / Volvo, this head), code hits 0.97 on the narrow rung
//! but only 0.875 on the wide rung (56/64), while prose hits 0.56..0.76 on
//! either. The two thresholds therefore see different processes: ENTER is
//! judged on the narrow rung (prose ~49 vs code ~62 of 64), LEAVE on the wide
//! rung (prose ~40..49 vs code ~56). The costs are asymmetric too: code on the
//! narrow rung loses ~18% (51 vs 63 tok/s), prose on the wide rung ~8% (24.8
//! vs 27.0), so LEAVE sits low and the resolver leaves wide reluctantly.
//!
//! The width is a DRAFT COUNT handed to the drafter per propose; the head runs
//! that many block rows (never more than it was sized for) and the verify
//! graphs on both sides are keyed by width, so after each width's first
//! capture a switch costs nothing. Sticky with hysteresis and a dwell, never
//! per step.
//!
//! Pinned (no resolver) when the operator passes `--dflash-gamma` explicitly
//! (a record run is a fixed configuration with a reproduction key) or sets
//! `AVAROK_DFLASH_STATIC_GAMMA` (presence). `AVAROK_DFLASH_GAMMA_RESOLVER`
//! (presence) turns it on even under an explicit flag, which then acts as the
//! cap. On the record: a resolved single-stream run is NOT reproducible by
//! any fixed-gamma run once it switches mid-stream; records stay per fixed
//! config.
//!
//! The trigger is an EXACT 64-step window, not a smoothed average: one bit per
//! verify step (first draft accepted or not) in a shift register, decided on
//! the popcount. A 10-step EWMA of a 0.76 process has sigma ~0.10 and brushed
//! the enter line about once per hundred steps (measured 2026-09-03: a flip
//! up and, one dwell later, a flip back, inside a single prose request).
//! Sized by simulation (300 seeds x 2000 steps per cell): at 60 of 64 with a
//! 64-step dwell, steady prose (0.76) flips up 0.11 times per 2000 steps and
//! steady code (0.97) 0.01; a real transition flips once, ~65 steps after it
//! (~8 s at C=1). LEAVE was first set at 55, which sits ON wide-rung code's
//! mean of 56 and dropped a MinHeap request to the narrow rung in its
//! docstring block (2026-09-04, hits=55/64; 93% of 140-step code requests
//! would drop at 55). At 46, Bin(64, 0.875) is below the line 6.5e-4 per
//! sample, ~1.3% of code requests, while prose at 0.76 is below it 27% per
//! sample and leaves within the request 98% of the time (0.63: at once).
//! 44 was tried and left prose at 0.76 wide for a whole request 12% of the
//! time; the windows are sliding, so per-sample odds compound slowly. A 32-bit register at 29/27 was tried first and flipped 12.8
//! times per 2000 prose steps: the tails of Bin(32, 0.76) are fat.
//!
//! Overrides (tuning, all optional, read ONCE in [`configure`] and held in
//! atomics so the per-step path is plain loads): `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_MULTI`
//! (K at C>=2, default 4), `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_NARROW` (C=1 prose K, default
//! 5), `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_WIDE` (C=1 code K, default = cap),
//! `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_ENTER` (window hits at/above which C=1 goes wide, 60),
//! `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_LEAVE` (hits at/below which it goes narrow, 46),
//! `AVAROK_DFLASH_RUNG_DWELL` (min steps between switches, 64 = one window).
//!
//! The C>=2 rung is K=4 BECAUSE of the write-on-accept kernel (#844). With
//! that kernel off the rung falls back to the cap: a K=4 parent-kernel serve
//! had no receipt in either PR, and every width this resolver hands out by
//! default must have one. NOTE (recut onto main): main made write-on-accept
//! OPT-IN (`AVAROK_GDN_WOA=1`, see `gdn_flags::gdn_woa_enabled`), so on main
//! this fallback is the DEFAULT C>=2 behaviour unless the operator opts in.
