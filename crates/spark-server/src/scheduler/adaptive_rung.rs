//! Accept-rate-aware n=16 ladder rung (wave 28).
//!
//! # Why the static rung cannot win
//!
//! Wave 27 measured the SAME two serve boots produce OPPOSITE signs at the
//! n=16 width depending only on the shape of the traffic:
//!
//! | workload | p1 | p2_cond | token ratio | cost ratio | winner |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | decode_short L=64 | 0.840 | 0.542 | 1.186 | 1.170 | tie |
//! | decode_short L=128 | 0.773 | 0.539 | 1.218 | 1.234 | `16:1` +1.2% |
//! | decode_short L=1024 | 0.732 | 0.567 | 1.229 | 1.258 | `16:1` +2.4% |
//! | tool-shaped, natural EOS | 0.917 | **0.877** | **1.424** | 1.223 | `16:2` **+7.9%** |
//!
//! Depth pays iff the token ratio clears the step-cost ratio. The COST ratio
//! is nearly constant (1.17-1.26 measured; wave 19's ladder comment claimed
//! 1.306, which is WRONG and is corrected in `ladder.rs`). The TOKEN ratio is
//! what moves, and it is driven by the SECOND-token conditional accept
//! `p2_cond`, which is bimodal: ~0.54 on prose, 0.877 on structured
//! function-call text. `p1` barely separates the regimes by comparison
//! (0.72-0.92) and is nearly identical between the two arms of the same
//! workload, i.e. the accept rate is a property of the TRAFFIC, not the rung.
//!
//! Output length is NOT the regime variable — the wave-27 length sweep is
//! flat and signless — so a length-aware rung would be the wrong fix.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! `token_ratio = (1 + p1 + p1*p2_cond) / (1 + p1) = 1 + p1*p2_cond/(1 + p1)`
//!
//! and `k=2` wins iff that clears the cost ratio. Evaluated on the four
//! wave-27 points the formula reproduces the measurement: 1.247 / 1.235 /
//! 1.240 on prose against **1.420** on tool-shaped (measured 1.424).
//!
//! # Where the band sits, and why it is ABOVE the arithmetic break-even
//!
//! The arithmetic break-even is the measured cost ratio, 1.17-1.26. The band
//! is placed HIGHER, at [`LEAVE`] = 1.30 / [`ENTER`] = 1.32, for two reasons,
//! both empirical:
//!
//! 1. At the margin the two-term model is optimistic. Prose measures a token
//!    ratio of 1.218-1.229 and a LOSS for `k=2` — the model omits prefill
//!    dilution, the host verdict walk over the extra rows, and graph
//!    switching, all of which favour the cheaper state. Break-even in
//!    PRACTICE is above break-even in ARITHMETIC.
//! 2. The band must separate two measured regimes, not sit inside one. The
//!    highest prose observation is 1.247 and the tool observation is 1.420;
//!    1.30/1.32 sits ~4.3% above the former and ~7% below the latter, so
//!    neither regime lands in the dead band and neither is one noisy flush
//!    away from flipping.
//!
//! The band is ASYMMETRIC (enter high, leave lower) because the two states
//! are not symmetric: `k=1` is the cheaper, lower-variance state and the one
//! that clears the campaign's same-box vLLM C=16 bar, so depth must be
//! EARNED on strong evidence and is surrendered on weaker evidence.
//!
//! # Hysteresis and how `p2_cond` is observed at all
//!
//! ★ `p2_cond` is UNOBSERVABLE while running `k=1`: with one draft in flight
//! nothing ever proposes a second token, so no second-position match exists
//! to score. The controller must PROBE — spend a telemetry flush at `k=2`
//! purely to re-measure.
//!
//! ★★ AND A PROBE IS EXPENSIVE, which is the single most important measured
//! fact in this module. It is NOT the ~1-2% that `k=2`'s own step cost would
//! suggest. Measured on dgx1 2026-08-01 at C=16 from the flush timestamps: a
//! steady flush takes 1.16 s, the flush that ENTERS a probe takes 2.90 s, and
//! the flush that returns to `k=1` takes 1.18 s — so a probe costs
//! **+1.74 s, all of it on the way IN, and none on the way out**. That
//! asymmetry names the cause: the batched-verify graph for the rarely-used
//! `k` is LRU-EVICTED between probes (the cache is keyed on the ssm-slot
//! vector as well as `k`, and slot vectors churn), so every probe pays a
//! fresh n=16 graph CAPTURE, while the constantly-used `k=1` graph never
//! leaves the cache. A naive fixed 12.5% duty cycle therefore cost
//! **-11.2%** at C=16 on prose (159.76 against a same-binary static `16:1`
//! control of 179.96) — an order of magnitude worse than the arithmetic
//! predicted, and enough on its own to sink the rung.
//!
//! The fix is NOT to keep both graphs resident (that means growing
//! `VERIFY_BATCHED_GRAPH_CAP` and its memory against a churning key space,
//! for a state we enter rarely). It is to make probes RARE by spending them
//! only when there is reason to. `p1` is observed for FREE at every flush in
//! every state; `p2_cond` is what costs 1.74 s. And the two co-move strongly
//! across the regimes that matter (prose p1 0.72-0.77, tool-shaped 0.79-0.98
//! — a 0.17 gap against a per-flush EWMA noise of ~0.012, i.e. ~14 sigma).
//! So the controller uses the free signal to decide when to spend on the
//! expensive one: it probes when `p1` has RISEN by [`P1_TRIGGER`] above the
//! `p1` at which the current state was last confirmed, plus a long
//! [`PROBE_TICKS`] backstop to catch a `p2_cond` drift at constant `p1`.
//!
//! Two details, both paid for in measurements:
//!
//! * The trigger uses its OWN slow EWMA ([`ALPHA_SLOW`] = 0.15, window ~7
//!   flushes ~ 8 s), NOT the fast decision EWMA. Measured per-flush `p1`
//!   noise at n=16 on prose is sigma = 0.053 — far higher than the decision
//!   loop cares about — which through the fast alpha=0.5 EWMA leaves ~0.031
//!   of wander. A trigger read off THAT signal fires on jitter: at 0.06 it
//!   spent 16 probes in 236 flushes and still cost -4.8% on prose. The slow
//!   EWMA cuts the noise to ~0.015, which makes [`P1_TRIGGER`] = 0.08 a
//!   ~4-sigma event on steady traffic and a ~0.17 (>10-sigma) certainty on a
//!   prose-to-tool change.
//! * The trigger is ONE-SIDED — only a RISE in `p1` buys a probe. The token
//!   ratio is monotone increasing in `p1` at fixed `p2_cond`, so a fall can
//!   never make depth newly attractive, and ignoring it halves the false-fire
//!   rate for free.
//!
//! In steady traffic that is ~0 probes and ~0 cost; on a regime change it is
//! one probe within ~5 flushes (~6 s), which is inside a single agentic
//! burst.
//!
//! In the `k=2` state no probe is ever needed — every flush is a depth flush,
//! so `p2_cond` is observed continuously and for free.
//!
//! Estimates are EWMAs with `alpha` = [`ALPHA`] = 0.5, i.e. an effective
//! window of `1/alpha` = 2 samples. A sample is one `mtp_accept_debug` flush
//! = `PERIOD` (128) verifies = 8 steps at n=16 ~ 1 s, so the window is ~2 s
//! of traffic and the probe interval ([`PROBE_TICKS`] = 8 flushes ~ 8 s)
//! dominates convergence. Sized against the WORKLOAD, not against noise: a
//! tool-regime rep is ~15 s, so a rung that needed 3+ probes to latch would
//! spend most of a short agentic burst in the wrong state. Noise is handled
//! by the dead band instead — 128 verifies give p1 a standard error of
//! ~0.037 and the token ratio ~0.015, against a 0.17 gap between the two
//! measured regimes (~11 sigma), so a single noisy flush cannot flip the
//! rung and flipping every step (which would thrash the verify CUDA graphs)
//! cannot happen. Estimates are seeded on the first sample rather than from
//! zero, so the first probe is acted on immediately instead of after a ramp.
//!
//! ★ Graph residency: the batched-verify graph cache is LRU keyed on
//! `(ssm-slot vector, k)` with `VERIFY_BATCHED_GRAPH_CAP` = 32 entries, so
//! BOTH `k` graphs stay resident across a flip at a stable slot vector — a
//! switch costs one capture the first time each `k` is seen at that vector
//! and replays thereafter. No re-capture churn, no cap change, no extra
//! reserve budget.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Adaptation applies ONLY to the 9..=16 width band (the n=16 rung). n<=8 and
//! n>16 take the static ladder unchanged.
