//! Phase-C: mid-step rollback + re-steer for decode-time watchdogs.
//!
//! Atlas's degeneration watchdogs (content-phase loop, fuzzy-repetition,
//! inter-tool prose budget) historically *hard-stopped* a sequence —
//! `finished = true` — which kills the response, often mid-tool-call.
//!
//! Per arXiv:2603.27905 (ATLAS-RTC) and ROM boundary-truncation
//! (arXiv:2603.22016), the principled recovery is to **roll back to the
//! last well-formed boundary and let generation re-steer**, rather than
//! discarding the whole turn. [`rollback_to_boundary`] implements that.
//!
//! ## KV-cache rewind: what is and is not feasible mid-decode
//!
//! Atlas uses a **paged** attention KV cache. A decode step writes K/V
//! into the slot at `seq.seq_len`, then advances `seq.seq_len`. So
//! "rewinding" attention is simply lowering `seq.seq_len`: the stale K/V
//! slots beyond the new length are overwritten by the next decode and
//! never read in the interim (attention only reads `[0, seq_len)`). The
//! paged `block_table` is left intact — its physical blocks are reused.
//! This is exactly the rewind the self-speculative path already performs
//! (`spec_step.rs`: `seq.seq_len -= 1; seq.tokens.pop()`), so we reuse
//! that mechanism rather than inventing a new one.
//!
//! ## SSM / Mamba recurrent state rewind
//!
//! The recurrent `h_state` / `conv_state` of an SSM layer is updated
//! in-place every token and CANNOT be undone by lowering a cursor. To
//! roll a **hybrid model** (attention + Mamba/SSM — Qwen3.6-A3B,
//! MiniMax, Nemotron-nano) back correctly, the SSM state must be
//! *restored from a snapshot* taken at the target boundary.
//!
//! Phase-C therefore keeps a per-sequence [`SsmDecodeRing`] of SSM
//! snapshots taken **at boundary tokens during normal decode** (see
//! `decode_logits_step.rs`). The snapshots reuse the model's
//! `SsmSnapshotPool` — the same GPU D2D mechanism Marconi prefix
//! caching and MTP verify use (SSOT). A rollback on a hybrid model
//! restores the SSM state via `Model::restore_decode_ssm_snapshot`
//! alongside the KV + grammar rewind.
//!
//! **Correctness gate (no approximation):** for a hybrid model the
//! rollback target is restricted to a boundary that has a *live ring
//! snapshot*. If no eligible boundary exists the rollback is **declined**
//! ([`RollbackFallback::NoSsmSnapshot`]) and the caller falls back to the
//! legacy hard stop — an honest "cannot safely roll back", not a
//! fake/partial SSM rewind. Pure-attention models
//! ([`Model::has_ssm_layers`] is `false`) have no recurrent state and
//! roll back to any boundary exactly as before. The whole feature stays
//! gated behind the `[behavior].rollback_resteer` MODEL.toml flag.
