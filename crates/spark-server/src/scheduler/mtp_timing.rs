//! Env-gated phase timing for the MTP K=2 verify path (#237 fixed-overhead hunt).
//!
//! `AVAROK_MTP_TIMING=1` arms per-phase accumulators across the verify step:
//! sync/EP/forward, the per-position host pipeline (D2H, dequant, processor
//! stages, penalties, argmax), grammar mask fills (both `fill_bitmask` and the
//! `forced_token` path, which computes a full mask of its own), SSM/proposer
//! state bookkeeping, MTP propose, and the Marconi checkpoint. A single
//! `info!` summary is emitted every [`SUMMARY_PERIOD`] completed verify steps
//! (no per-token spam), then the accumulators reset.
//!
//! Purely diagnostic: zero behavioral effect, and near-zero cost when the env
//! is unset (`RunTiming::armed` is a plain bool; `record` returns immediately).
//!
//! `AVAROK_MTP_GATE_FORCE=1` (diagnostic companion, wired in `scheduler::mod`)
//! disarms the throughput gate so verify steps keep flowing even in a regime
//! the gate would call net-negative — required to collect ~100 verify samples
//! for attribution. Never set in production.
