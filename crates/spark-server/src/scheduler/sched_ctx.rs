//! [`SchedCtx`] — everything one scheduler run needs that is derived from the
//! model rather than from the request.
//!
//! The scheduler had no carrier at all: `run` takes its model-derived values as
//! positional parameters and threads them through the loop body as locals,
//! while everything that would not fit that shape — the vocabulary masks, the
//! `AVAROK_*` levers — ended up in process-global statics instead.
//!
//! This is the carrier those belong on. It is deliberately narrow: state that
//! is fixed for the run and read by the step functions. Per-request state stays
//! on `ActiveSeq`, and values the loop mutates stay locals.
