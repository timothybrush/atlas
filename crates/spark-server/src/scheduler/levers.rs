//! These steered the decode, verify and speculation paths from twenty-odd
//! `OnceLock<bool>` statics reading `ATLAS_*` at first touch; a static outlives
//! the model whose flags it encodes, and it declares nothing in the signature
//! of the function that reads it.
//!
//! One field is genuinely mutable at runtime — the loop watchdog, which the

//! That one is an [`AtomicBool`] inside the carried struct rather than a plain
//! `bool`: the mutation is real, so it is modelled, but it stays *inside* the
