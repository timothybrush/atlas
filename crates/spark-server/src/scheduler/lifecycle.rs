/// THE single mapping from a server-side guard (`ActiveSeq::guard_stop`)
/// to the wire `finish_reason`. Do not map guard names to wire reasons
/// anywhere else.
///
/// Every non-timeout guard reports `"length"`: the server ended the
/// response with the model UNFINISHED. Neither enum slot is literally
/// true — the budget was not hit either — so the choice is decided by
/// which lie clients handle safely.
///
/// `"stop"` asserts "the model said what it wanted". For a mid-sentence
/// repetition cut that is affirmatively false, and every client behaviour
/// keyed on `"stop"` is then the WRONG action: accept, validate, commit,
/// end the agent run. `"length"` asserts only "incomplete, serving side
/// cut it, do not treat as final" — true in every part clients act on,
/// and its handlers are all safe: `openai-python` raises
/// `LengthFinishReasonError` instead of parsing truncated JSON, aider
/// skips the auto-commit, Instructor raises `IncompleteOutputException`,
/// pydantic-ai raises rather than accepting a half tool call.
///
/// The failure modes are asymmetric. A false `"length"` costs a bounded,
/// VISIBLE retry (agents cap them). A false `"stop"` is unbounded and
/// INVISIBLE: degenerate output silently banked as a finished answer.
/// Measured — relabelling these guards to `"stop"` cost 2/10 then 6/10
/// episodes of the agentic gate, because the harness stopped recognising
/// truncation and ended runs at 3-10 turns instead of the 12-22 a
/// recovery takes.
///
/// This also matches the ecosystem. On every engine WITHOUT a
/// degeneration guard (SGLang, TGI, llama.cpp, vLLM by default) the same
/// loop simply runs to the budget and reports `"length"`; our guard is an
/// early, smarter budget, so `"length"` preserves parity. No engine maps a
/// quality cut to `"stop"` by design — vLLM minted a distinct value
/// (`"repetition"`) rather than overload it.
///
/// ★ And it removes an internal contradiction: `tool_loop_capped` already
/// ships `"length"` (see `api::chat_stream::handle_done`) on exactly this
/// reasoning — `"length"` is the OpenAI-spec slot for "forcibly truncated"
/// and gives agents a clean hook to break their outer loop. The same
/// argument covers `fuzzy_repetition`, `tool_envelope_stuck`,
/// `inter_tool_prose_budget` and the simhash trip.
///
/// Considered alternative: putting the guard name on the wire the way
/// vLLM ships "repetition"/"abort". Rejected — typed clients hard-fail on
/// unknown enum VALUES (Rust `async-openai` fails deserialization
/// outright; pydantic-ai raised on OpenRouter's non-standard "error"),
/// and our one deliberate exception, `"timeout"`, already carries that
/// documented risk (see `ir::FINISH_REASON_TIMEOUT`). The guard's NAME
/// reaches diagnostics via `StreamEvent::Done.guard_stop` and the --dump
/// body; the right home for it on the wire is an extension FIELD (unknown
/// fields are ignored by every SDK, cf. vLLM's `stop_reason`), which is
/// follow-up work, not a reason to keep lying in the enum.
