//! Phase-C decode-time SSM-snapshot ring.
//!
//! For hybrid (attention + Mamba/SSM) models the boundary rollback
//! ([`super::rollback::rollback_to_boundary`]) cannot simply lower a
//! cursor the way it rewinds the paged attention KV cache: the SSM
//! `h_state` + `conv_state` are recurrent, advanced in-place by every
//! decoded token. Undoing them requires a *snapshot* of the state as it
//! was at an earlier token.
//!
//! This ring records, per active sequence, a small bounded set of SSM
//! snapshots taken **at boundary tokens during normal decode** — the
//! same boundary tokens [`super::rollback::find_last_boundary`] selects.
//! Each entry pairs the absolute generated-token position with the
//! decode-rollback snapshot *slot* the model wrote the GPU-side state
//! into (the GPU memory itself is owned by the model's
//! `SsmSnapshotPool`; this struct only tracks slot indices).
//!
//! Snapshotting only at boundary tokens — not every token — keeps the
//! cost bounded: at most `capacity` D2D copies are live per sequence,
//! and the ring evicts oldest-first so a long generation never grows
//! the set. `capacity` is the model's
//! `decode_rollback_ring_slots()` — 8 by default, so every permitted
//! rollback has a distinct snapshot plus the current boundary, but as
//! low as 0 when `--ssm-decode-ring-slots` or preflight's free-memory
//! fit (#915) says so. A smaller ring retains fewer boundaries and so
//! reaches fewer re-steer anchors; 0 declines every rollback.
//!
//! Memory cost: each slot stores `h_state + conv_state` for **all** SSM
//! layers. Per marconi.md that is ~77 MB/slot for a 122B/36-layer model;
//! a 35B-A3B hybrid is far smaller. The full decode-rollback region is
//! `capacity × max_batch_size` slots, allocated once at model init.

/// One recorded boundary snapshot: the generated-token position it was
/// taken at, and the model-side snapshot slot holding the GPU state.
