//! Downloading a model from HuggingFace, and telling whether the local copy is
//! current.
//!
//! Atlas could previously only *consume* a model that was already in the HF
//! cache; a recipe naming a checkpoint you did not have dead-ended with advice
//! to go and run `huggingface-cli`. This is the missing half.
//!
//! # Where this lives
//!
//! Beside `model_resolver`, not under `tui/`, because it is a server capability
//! and because the resolver owns the cache-layout knowledge this must agree
//! with — [`hf::publish`] calls the resolver's own `snapshot_has_weights`
//! rather than reimplementing the check that decides whether a download counts
//! as finished.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! The dashboard's rule holds here: the render thread never polls a future, it
//! only `try_recv`s. The work runs on a plain `std::thread` named
//! `avarok-download`, and progress arrives on a `std::sync::mpsc`. See
//! `recipe/fetch.rs` for the full statement and
//! `.github/workflows/tui-threading.yml` for its enforcement.
//!
//! # The ordering that matters
//!
//! `refs/main` is written **last**, and only after the snapshot verifies. It
//! is the sole marker that a download finished: until it exists, the resolver
//! refuses the model outright, so a process killed at shard 2 of 9 leaves a
//! resumable partial rather than a model that looks loadable and is not.
