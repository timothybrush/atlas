//! The decode-rollback ring reserve term and its #915 auto-fit.
//!
//! A sibling of `preflight.rs` (which sits at the 500-line cap), following
//! the `per_sequence_state.rs` precedent: the term, the formula it prints and
//! the shrink decision live here; `preflight.rs` gains only the calls.
//!
//! # Why this term needed a fit and not just a number
//!
//! `ssm_snapshot_bytes` multiplies a CONSTANT ring depth (8) by
//! `--max-batch-size`, a flag that says nothing about what the card can hold.
//! Serving Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 on one 80 GB H100 with the hopper recipe
//! (`--max-batch-size 32`, 48 GDN layers, 151.5 MiB per-seq state blob) that
//! is 8 x 32 x 151.5 MiB = 37.88 GiB of ring inside a 45,823 MiB inference
//! reserve, against a 71.3 GiB budget already carrying 57.2 GiB of weights —
//! and the serve REFUSED to boot (rental H100, 2026-09-05, evidence cell
//! `qwen38.atlas.a.lat.c1`). The shipped workaround was `--max-batch-size 4`
//! (cell `qwen38.atlas.c.lat.c1`, reserve 8.54 GiB, GO in 22 s): paying for
//! rollback depth with four fifths of the serve's concurrency.
//!
//! Ring depth degrades GRACEFULLY (fewer retained boundaries = fewer
//! reachable re-steer anchors; a sequence that finds none hard-stops through
//! `RollbackFallback::NoSsmSnapshot`, which is an honest decline, never a
//! partial SSM rewind). Batch does not: it is the serve's concurrency. So the
//! term that yields is the ring, and it yields down
//! `ssm_reserve::DECODE_RING_FIT_LADDER` until the whole reserve fits.
