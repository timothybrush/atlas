//! The pre-load reserve REFUSAL: what it suggests, and why it asked for what
//! it asked for.
//!
//! A sibling of `preflight.rs` (which sits at the 500-line cap), same
//! precedent as `per_sequence_state.rs` and `decode_ring.rs`.
//!
//! Refusal is now the LAST resort, not the first answer: the decode-rollback
//! ring shrinks to fit before this runs (#915), so reaching here means the
//! configuration does not fit even with no rollback depth at all. That makes
//! the text load-bearing — it is the only thing an operator has to act on —
//! which is why it carries the ring formula as well as a suggested batch.
