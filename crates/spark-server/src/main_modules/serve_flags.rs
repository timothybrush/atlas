//! Publishing the command line's kernel-path selections.
//!
//! Each of these was an `ATLAS_*` variable read at its own call site. They are
//! CONFIGURATION — the concurrency campaign's best recipe needs three of them —
//! so they belong on the command line, where `--help` lists them, `ps` shows
//! them and a recipe can be read without a ten-line env preamble. The variables
//! stay honoured as a fallback for scripts that predate the flags.
//!
//! ## Absent is not a value
//!
//! Every cell below is a `OnceLock` whose fallback closure reads the
//! environment on first touch. Publishing a clap DEFAULT into one seals it
//! before anything asks, which makes the fallback unreachable — so five
//! documented `ATLAS_*` variables were inert under `spark serve` while
//! `--help` still described them and the startup log still echoed the flag back.
//! Every flag here is therefore an `Option`, and an absent flag publishes
//! NOTHING.
