//! Ollama-style auto-swap: a request naming a different known model loads it.
//!
//! **Deliberately narrow.** Clients send arbitrary strings in `model` — the
//! benchmark harness sends whatever `--model` was typed, and Atlas has always
//! answered regardless (`lora_control.rs`: any unknown name falls through to
//! the installed adapter, never a 400). Turning a cosmetic mismatch into an
//! error would break every existing caller, and turning it into a swap would
//! make a typo a multi-minute outage.
//!
//! So only one case acts:
//!
//! | request `model`                     | action                        |
//! |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
//! | absent / empty                      | ignore — serve current        |
//! | not resolvable to a known recipe    | ignore — serve current        |
//! | resolves to the model already live  | ignore — no swap              |
//! | resolves to a DIFFERENT known model | swap, then serve              |
//!
//! And it is off unless `--auto-swap` is passed: even narrowed to known models,
//! one stray request is a multi-minute outage for every other client on the
//! box, and a benchmark sweep naming a sibling checkpoint would swap mid-run.
