//! Cool-down: a box that warms up mid-campaign is parked until it is back
//! near where it started, and the rest of the fleet keeps working.
//!
//! Before a worker takes another unit it reads the node's hottest chassis
//! zone and the driver's thermal-throttle flag. At the class's
//! `chassis_park_c` or above, or with the throttle asserted, the node is
//! PARKED: it takes nothing more and re-reads every [`RECHECK`] until the
//! zone is at or below `chassis_resume_c` and the throttle is clear
//! (hysteresis, so a box does not flap on the threshold). The two lines are
//! the target's, from `kernels/<hw>/HARDWARE.toml`
//! `[benchmarks.limits.thermal]` (`hardware::thermal`), never a constant
//! named after one card. Nothing else waits for it — the scheduler is work-conserving,
//! so pending units go to whichever node is free — and a parked box that
//! hosts the bundled Speed class simply delays that class.
//!
//! ★ Absolute, not relative to the box's rest temperature. The first cut
//! parked at +20 °C over the plan-time baseline, and the first campaign under
//! it parked both remote boxes after their first unit: a GB10 rises 26-33 °C
//! over rest under any gate (43 → 76, 39 → 65 on 2026-09-15) and needs a
//! long idle to come back within 5 — "close to baseline" is where a box is
//! only when it is not working. What is abnormal is a box in throttle
//! territory: the 0.66 tok/s incident was a chassis at 89 °C with the driver
//! reporting a thermal slowdown; every healthy loaded box today read 55-76.
//!
//! Why: the 2026-09-15 campaign spread its Speed class over two boxes that
//! were 43/40 °C at plan time and 55/68 °C in the records — one had run
//! five gates back to back — and `gate::agreement` refused the pair. The
//! equivalence policy judges the RECORDS; this keeps the boxes in the state
//! the policy assumed, and keeps a hot box from being driven hotter. The
//! thresholds are the operator's cut, not a measurement: a GB10 warms 12-28
//! °C over rest under a campaign, and the 0.66 tok/s incident was a box at
//! 89 °C (24 °C over its peer).
//!
//! A reading that cannot be taken parks nothing: the safety net for a wrong
//! reading is the record-level check, and a blind probe must not stop a
//! campaign. It is said, once.
//!
//! `--dangerous-ignore-thermals` turns every park into a WARNING and lets
//! the box keep taking units: the operator has decided the hardware is
//! theirs to risk. The equivalence policy still judges the records at the
//! end — the flag ignores the security action, never the evidence.
