//! Cross-flag CLI validation (issue #288).

//! `clap` validates each flag in isolation; it cannot catch *combinations* that
//! contradict each other (e.g. `--kv-cache-dtype bf16` together with
//! `--fp8-kv-calibration-tokens 256`, where the calibration can never apply).
//! Such combinations silently do the wrong thing and — because operators copy
//! working command lines around and publish them — the mistake propagates.
//!
//! [`validate_serve_args`] turns every known-contradictory combination into a
//! **hard error** (never a warning), collected and reported together, with a
//! message shaped for both humans and AI agents: each finding states *what* is
//! wrong, *why*, and the concrete *fix*. It runs before the (multi-minute)
//! model load so a bad invocation fails in milliseconds.
//!
//! Add new rules here as flags are added — this is the single place invalid
//! combinations are rejected.
