//! Emitting the serve flag surface as a machine-readable snapshot.
//!
//! **This is a build artifact, not a public interface.** `ServeArgs` still has
//! no `Serialize` derive and this does not give it one: nothing here promises
//! that a flag will keep its name, and a rename shows up as a diff in whatever
//! consumes the snapshot rather than as a silent break. That is the point —
//! `atlas-recipes` currently hand-transcribes this surface from a *Python*
//! launcher that predates the Rust one, and the drift is invisible until a
//! launch dies inside a container.
//!
//! The reflection is the same one [`crate::tui::lib_fields`] already does, for
//! the same reason: clap is the single source of truth for the flag surface,
//! so reading it beats writing it down twice. What this adds over the TUI's
//! view is the **action** — whether a flag is presence-only — which is what a
//! downstream renderer cannot guess and gets wrong in a way that only fails on
//! the machine, at launch.
