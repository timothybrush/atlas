//! The last thing a failed child said, for an error that has to outlive its
//! log.
//!
//! Two logs sit between a gate failure and whoever reads it. A leased serve
//! writes to `serve-lease.log` on the node, append-only across a campaign
//! (126 MB on 2026-09-22); the gate child writes to `child.log`, which the
//! agent hands back. When the serve dies at boot the whole diagnosis is the
//! `Error:` / `Caused by:` block at the end of the first, and until #1242 the
//! certify orchestrator printed "the node returned no record" instead. Both
//! readers use this: the lease embeds the serve's block in its own error, and
//! placement embeds the child's block in its refusal.
