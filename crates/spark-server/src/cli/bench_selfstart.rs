//! Serve a benchmark's own recipe for the duration of a gate run.
//!
//! A gate record is only worth what its serve config is worth. Driving a
//! hand-started endpoint means one mistyped flag silently moves every number in
//! the record, and nothing downstream can tell — which is the failure this gate
//! exists to catch, reproduced one level up. So `--pull-request-gate` does not
//! trust the caller: it reads the recipe the benchmark's baseline names, serves
//! that, and measures what it started.
//!
//! Without the flag nothing here runs and `--url`/`--model` drive an existing
//! server exactly as before.
//!
//! ## Start-once-per-process
//!
//! Teardown goes through `shutdown::request`, and that latch is ONE-WAY — there
//! is no reset, so once it is tripped `run_blocking`'s cancel check and
//! `model_swap`'s load guard both stay tripped for the life of the process. One
//! invocation therefore serves exactly one model and then exits. A second
//! self-start in the same process is refused with a real message rather than
//! left to hang on a listener that will never come up.
//!
//! ## Teardown on EVERY path
//!
//! This mode manages a model on a unified-memory box, where a leaked serve does
//! not waste a GPU, it wedges the machine. So the handle lives inside
//! [`SelfServed`], which tears it down in `Drop` — not only in the explicit
//! `shutdown()`. Dropping a `JoinHandle` DETACHES the task, so every `?` between
//! the spawn and the caller's teardown used to leak a loaded model: a boot
//! timeout inside [`serve_for`] and an artifact-store failure in `bench_run`
//! both did. The `Drop` makes those paths — and a panic — teardowns rather than
//! leaks.
