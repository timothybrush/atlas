//! The Serve Matrix's [`ServeHost`], backed by this process's model host.
//!
//! `avarok-plugin` must stay GPU-free and server-free, so the benchmark declares
//! the seam and this supplies it. Two things it owes the benchmark, and both
//! are the fix for a defect in `tests/run_all_models.py`:
//!
//! * **The roster is derived.** `library::scan` reports what is in the HF cache
//!   and `avarok_kernels::ptx_for_config` decides whether this build compiled
//!   kernels for it. Nothing here lists a model. The Python's `ROUNDS` is a
//!   hand-maintained Qwen3.5-era list of twelve checkpoints, not one of which
//!   is in this box's cache — a second roster that went stale silently.
//!
//! * **Readiness is the endpoint answering.** The Python watched the container
//!   log for `Listening on`, a substring that also matches
//!   `Listening on 127.0.0.1:8888` — a server bound to loopback inside a
//!   bridged namespace, which every probe then failed to reach with
//!   "connection reset by peer" that read exactly like a model regression.
//!   Here the round is served by an in-process swap onto the port this server
//!   is ALREADY bound to, so there is no second bind to get wrong, and `serve`
//!   still does not return until `/v1/models` names the new checkpoint.
