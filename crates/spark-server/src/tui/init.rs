//! Subscriber installation + the switchable log writer.
//!
//! Plain mode (`tui::plain_mode()` true) never reaches this file — `main.rs`
//! keeps the pre-TUI 5-line `fmt().init()` byte-for-byte, which is the format
//! every benchmark driver greps.
//!
//! TUI mode installs a `Registry` with three layers:
//!  1. fmt layer (`ansi=false`) → [`SwitchableWriter`]: every formatted line
//!     goes to the tee FILE always (the alternate screen eats stdout, so the
//!     file is the post-mortem record) and to raw stdout whenever the TUI is
//!     not active (before attach / after detach / after a panic restore).
//!  2. [`super::log_ring::LogRingLayer`] — structured lines for the log pane.
//!  3. [`super::capture_layer::ProgressCaptureLayer`] — typed progress events,
//!     always-on for its dedicated target.
//!
//! Layers 1 and 2 share `RUST_LOG` semantics via two `EnvFilter` instances
//! built from the same spec, so the pane shows exactly what stdout would.
