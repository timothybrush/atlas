//! Issue reporting: the GitHub protocol as PURE functions — response parsing,
//! failure mapping, body assembly — with no I/O in this file. The two HTTPS
//! calls live behind [`report_http`](super::report_http)'s transport seam, so
//! every row of the failure table is unit-testable without a network.
//!
//! # Auth model (why device flow, and why nothing is stored)
//!
//! The TUI is a public client: anything compiled into it is readable by every
//! user, so no client secret can exist here. GitHub's device flow is the OAuth
//! grant built for that — `client_id` only, the user types a short code into
//! github.com, and the resulting user token acts only on repos the GitHub App
//! is installed on (`Issues: write` + `Metadata: read`, nothing else).
//!
//! The access and refresh tokens live in [`SecretString`]s in process memory
//! for the process lifetime and nowhere else — never written to disk, never
//! logged, never in the issue body (CWE-522/CWE-256). These are shared boxes:
//! a token file would be readable by every session running as this user, now
//! and from backups. The cost is one browser authorization per server process
//! that reports an issue; the 8-hour token expiry plus the in-memory refresh
//! token covers the rest of the process's life without another round-trip.
