//! The event loop's decisions, as values.
//!
//! `events::run` owns a real terminal — a `CrosstermBackend` over stdout, raw
//! mode, and a `poll`/`read` pair only a tty answers. None of it is reachable
//! from the `TestBackend` the rest of this tree's suite drives: the terminal
//! has to actually be there, or actually refuse.
//!
//! That is not a reason for the loop's RULES to live there too. Everything
//! below is a pure function of values the loop already holds, so the suite
//! reaches each one directly and the loop reads as the sequence of side
//! effects it is. The precedent is `events::on_mouse` / `events::sidebar_row`,
//! extracted for the same reason after a click on `Main ▸ Overview` selected
//! Stats.
//!
//! ★ The rule that was a live bug is deliberately NOT here. `TUI_ACTIVE` was
//! released by a single statement at the bottom of the loop that two early
//! `return`s jumped over, and no pure function fixes a missing call — see
//! [`super::init::ActiveClaim`], which fixes it by construction.
