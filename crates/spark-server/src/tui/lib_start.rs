//! Starting points: what Enter offers on a model no recipe covers.
//!
//! A local-only checkpoint used to be a dead end — the list said "no recipe"
//! and Enter refused, leaving the user to reconstruct a serve command from
//! scratch outside the dashboard. This module synthesizes candidate configs
//! to start FROM: the published recipes re-aimed at this model, plus one
//! blank card that is nothing but the server's own defaults.
//!
//! None of it is a measurement. A published recipe's description is a
//! gate-measured rationale for one checkpoint; copying its settings onto a
//! different checkpoint keeps the settings and loses the evidence. Every
//! synthesized card therefore carries `Recipe::starting_point`, its
//! description says what was copied from where, and the donor's `updated`
//! date is dropped — a date on the card would read as "verified then".
