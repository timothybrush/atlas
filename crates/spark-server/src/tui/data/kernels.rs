//! Kernel-table model for Main ▸ Kernels: the LOADED target's embedded module
//! set joined with the runtime resolution audit — the same data
//! `render_kernel_table` prints, as rows a real `Table` widget can sort/filter.
//!
//! The module set has to come from the target serve actually resolved
//! (published here, looked up via `ptx_for_exact_target`).
//! `avarok_kernels::ptx_modules()` is emitted as a
//! plain alias of TARGET 0 in a multi-target build (`build_codegen.rs`), and
//! targets are sorted by directory name — so on every model except
//! `deepseek-v4-flash` it rendered another architecture's modules: phantom
//! rows, no row at all for the modules the live model actually uses, and every
//! PTX hash wrong. The table is the instrument this whole audit is read
//! through; while it named the wrong target, it was worse than absent.
