//! The switchable log writer, without installing a subscriber.
//!
//! `install_tty_subscriber` is a once-per-process side effect — it sets the
//! global tracing dispatcher and fills a `OnceLock` — so calling it from a test
//! would decide the answer for every other test in the binary. What IS testable
//! is the part that runs on every log line afterwards: the writer must never
//! fail, never panic when no tee file was ever opened, and must fall silent for
//! stdout exactly while the TUI owns the screen. A writer that returns an error
//! or panics here takes the process down from inside `tracing`.
