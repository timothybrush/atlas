//! Library actions that need more than the Library's own state.
//!
//! The Library reducer (`lib_keys`) is deliberately pure: it has no cache
//! directory, no server handle and no way to spawn work, so it returns an
//! `Outcome` and something that does have those performs it. That something is
//! `App`, and these are the three it performs — download, cancel, and the
//! freshness check.
//!
//! Split out of `app.rs` when it reached the 500-LoC cap; they belong together
//! because they share the cache-root lookup and the "which model is selected"
//! question, and getting either wrong sends a multi-gigabyte request at the
//! wrong repository.
