//! Atlas TUI — the ratatui dashboard for `spark serve`.
//!
//! Activation is strictly opt-out-safe: [`plain_mode`] must return `false`
//! before any TUI machinery is touched, and when it returns `true` the caller
//! (`main.rs`) installs the pre-TUI `tracing_subscriber::fmt().init()`
//! UNCHANGED — that plain-log format is a compatibility contract with every
//! benchmark driver and gate script that greps `docker logs`.
//!
//! Module map (each file ≤450 LoC for the CI cap):
//!   init            subscriber stack, SwitchableWriter, tee file, TUI_ACTIVE
//!   terminal_guard  raw-mode RAII + idempotent restore + panic hook
//!   shutdown        one shutdown path: signals, Ctrl+C-as-key, /quit
//!   log_ring        structured log capture + global ring for the log pane
//!   capture_layer   typed startup-progress event decoding
//!   progress        ProgressModel — phases/shards/layers/ETA state machine
//!   events          input/tick event loop on the dedicated "avarok-tui" thread
//!   events_rules    the loop's decisions as pure functions, so they are testable
//!   help_state      Help section state + the issue-report phase machine
//!   help_keys       Help section key handling, one function per phase
//!   report          GitHub issue reporting, the pure protocol half
//!   report_http     GitHub issue reporting, the transport + worker threads
//!   redact          best-effort log scrubbing + size budget for reports
//!   section         Section — the sidebar/nav SSOT
//!   app             App state + reducer (section, focus, per-tab state)
//!   app_quit        what `q` costs, and when it costs a second press
//!   bench_state     Benchmarks section state + the executor's channels
//!   bench_keys      Benchmarks key handling (list / params / run / history)
//!   theme           palette + shared styles (brand chevron colors)
//!   format          byte counts and scheduler enums, as the screen says them
//!   logo            header art + CLI flag badge derivation
//!   commands        Terminal tab slash-command parser/dispatch
//!   chat            Chat transcript state + delta reducer
//!   chat_stream     loopback SSE chat client for the served model
//!   chat_thinking   thinking: what the client asks for, and how it is drawn
//!   data/           pollers: metrics deltas, library scan, kernel rows
//!   render/         one file per section, pure App-state -> Frame
//!   worker          the one way to run work off the render thread
//!
//! # Where the sync/async boundary is
//!
//! **The render thread never polls a future. Its only contact with work
//! happening elsewhere is `try_recv` on a channel.** That single rule is what
//! keeps this tree comprehensible, and
//! `.github/workflows/tui-threading.yml` fails the build if it is broken. Two
//! consequences worth stating plainly, because both were once decided
//! case-by-case:
//!
//! **Which side does a piece of work belong on?** Ask what it needs, not what
//! is fashionable:
//!
//!   * ASYNC, on the SERVING runtime — work that is already async, or that
//!     talks to this server over its own HTTP API. `chat` (loopback SSE) and
//!     `bench_preflight` + `avarok-plugin`'s executor (benchmarks are async
//!     end to end). These take a `tokio::runtime::Handle` captured at start.
//!   * SYNC, on a named `std::thread` — everything with no runtime need:
//!     blocking HTTPS via `ureq` (recipe index, recipe dates, model downloads,
//!     freshness checks), filesystem walks (the HF cache scan), and CUDA (the
//!     model swap). None of these are faster async, and an async filesystem
//!     does not exist — `tokio::fs` is a thread pool with nicer syntax.
//!
//! **Both sides answer the same way**, which is why the render loop needs only
//! one shape: a `std::sync::mpsc::Sender`, drained with `try_recv` on the tick.
//! There is no second idiom to learn and no third place to look.
//!
//! The threads, all named so a stack dump during an incident is attributable:
//! `avarok-tui` (this render loop) · `atlas-recipes` · `avarok-recipe-date` ·
//! `avarok-libscan` · `avarok-download` · `avarok-freshness` · `avarok-swap` ·
//! `avarok-report` (GitHub device flow + issue submit).
//!
//! The first five one-shot workers go through [`worker::spawn`], which owns the
//! part that is easy to forget: answering anyway when the thread will not
//! start, so a receiver cannot be polled forever. Two do not, for reasons:
//! `avarok-download` is a STREAMING producer (many progress messages, not one
//! result), and `avarok-swap` sends only on FAILURE — silence means "still
//! loading" — so an always-send helper would change what its silence means.
