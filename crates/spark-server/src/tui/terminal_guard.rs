//! Raw-mode/alternate-screen lifecycle with crash safety.
//!
//! The terminal MUST be restored on every exit path — clean quit, detach,
//! `?`-panic on ANY thread (CUDA `.expect()`s in the scheduler thread
//! included), or the process unwinding out of `main`. Three layers:
//!
//!  1. [`TerminalGuard`] — RAII: enters raw mode + alternate screen + mouse
//!     capture on construction, restores on `Drop`.
//!  2. [`restore`] — idempotent (an `AtomicBool` guards double-restore), so
//!     the guard's Drop and the panic hook can both call it safely.
//!  3. A process-global panic hook (installed once, chained to the previous
//!     hook) that restores the terminal FIRST — so the panic message and
//!     backtrace print onto a sane screen — then dumps the newest log-ring
//!     lines to stderr and points at the tee file.
//!
//! SIGKILL cannot be caught; `reset`/`stty sane` is the documented recovery.
