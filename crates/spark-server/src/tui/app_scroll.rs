//!
//! `App::{log,kernel,chat}_scroll_max` are written by the RENDERER each frame
//! and read here. The limit is `content_lines - viewport_height`, and only the
//! renderer knows either: the viewport is a layout result, and the content is
//! filtered and wrapped on the way to the screen. They are `Cell` because
//! `draw` takes `&App`.
//!
//! Without them the offset grew without bound past the first or last line —

//! the wheel as had been spent going up.
//!
//! Split from `app.rs` at the 500-LoC cap, and a coherent unit on its own: it
//! is the one place that knows what each section considers "scrolling". Two
//! rules hold across all of them and are easier to keep in one file —
//! a section routes the wheel to whatever its own KEYS already move, so wheel
//! and keyboard can never disagree about position; and a section with nothing
//! to scroll does nothing rather than guessing.
