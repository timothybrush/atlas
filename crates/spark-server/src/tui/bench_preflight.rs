//! The endpoint check that runs between pressing START and the benchmark
//! actually starting.
//!
//! A benchmark aimed at the wrong server is the cheapest mistake to make and
//! one of the most expensive to discover: BFCL scores a failed sample as "no
//! call", so a 12-hour run finishes and reports a near-zero accuracy that looks
//! exactly like a model regression.
//!
//! So the check happens first, and the user sees it happen. It takes two short
//! completions, which is long enough to need a spinner and short enough that a
//! progress bar would be a lie.
//!
//! **It cannot veto a run.** Benchmarking a base checkpoint, or pointing a
//! suite at a model it was not written for, are real things to do on purpose.
//! The modal reports what it saw and the user decides.
