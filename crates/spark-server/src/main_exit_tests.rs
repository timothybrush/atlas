//! The exit status of a faulted process is a COMPOSITION property (issue #429).
//!
//! `avarok_core::fault::exit_code` is a pure function with its own positive and
//! negative unit tests. Those prove the mapping is right; they cannot prove
//! `main` calls it. That gap is not theoretical — this campaign has already
//! shipped two fixes that were provably correct and entirely INERT because a
//! later writer clobbered the field they set (`StreamState.guard_stop`), and
//! the unit tests stayed green throughout.
//!
//! So this reads the source, like `cancel_guard_tests` and `coverage_map_tests`
//! do for the same reason: the property is structural, so the test is too.
//!
//! `main` has TWO exits — the startup escape hatch and the normal tail — and a
//! fault can latch on either side of the point that separates them (weight
//! upload and warmup both run before the server accepts). Covering one and not
//! the other is the shape of the original bug, so both are pinned.
