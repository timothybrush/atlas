//! The contract between the two halves of the closure hash.
//!
//! `avarok-kernels/build.rs` computes a target's sources with `collect_cu_files`
//! and bakes the hash into the binary. The gate recomputes them with
//! `avarok_plugin::gate::taxon::sources` and compares. Those are two separate
//! implementations of one rule, and if they ever disagree the hashes never
//! match, every record is invalidated forever, and the failure is INVISIBLE —
//! it looks exactly like "the kernels changed", which is the normal case.
//!
//! Fail-closed is the right direction, but a silently dead feature is still a
//! dead feature. This test is the only place the two halves are compared.
