/// **STATIC, AND THIS IS THE CASE WHERE IT MUST BE.** The argument, in full,
/// because the standing rule is that every surviving static earns one:
///
/// 1. **It is derived from the process and the device, not from any model.** A
///    CUDA context belongs to a (process, GPU) pair. Nothing about a checkpoint
///    reaches it, so it cannot go stale when the model changes — the property
///    that makes every other static here a hazard simply does not apply.
/// 2. **The driver enforces the singleton anyway.** There is one primary
///    context per device per process. Holding two handles would not give two
///    contexts; it would give two names for the same one, with the ownership
///    question moved from the type system to a convention.
/// 3. **Its whole purpose is to outlive every model.** Not destroying and
///    recreating the context across a swap IS the feature — that operation is
///    slow, invalidates every handle in the process, and has the worst failure
///    modes on GB10 UVM. A context propagated per-model would have to be
///    recreated per-model, which is precisely what is being avoided.
/// 4. **Propagating it changes nothing it does not already guarantee.** Every
///    consumer reaches it through the `AvarokRegistry` it already holds
///    (`registry.host()`), so the *usage* is propagated. This static is only
///    the place the one context is created and found.
///
