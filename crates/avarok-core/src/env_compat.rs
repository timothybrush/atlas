//! Backwards compatibility shim for the `ATLAS_*` to `AVAROK_*` env rename.
//!
//! The repo-wide rebrand moved every variable the server reads from `ATLAS_*`
//! to `AVAROK_*`, but the CLI that launches the server lives in a different
//! repository and still exports the old names (recipes set things like
//! `ATLAS_MTP_DCUT_RATIO`, `ATLAS_FP8_ROWWISE`, `ATLAS_GDN_FLASHINFER`,
//! `ATLAS_GDN_LIB` and `ATLAS_TARGET_MODEL`; the agent sets `ATLAS_HOME`).
//! Without this shim a server built from the renamed tree ignores all of them
//! silently, which looks exactly like a recipe that does nothing.
//!
//! [`mirror_legacy_env`] copies each legacy name onto its new name at process
//! startup, so the ~440 `std::env::var("AVAROK_...")` reads scattered across
//! the crates need no per-site fallback.
//!
//! REMOVAL POINT: delete this module, its call sites in `main`, and the
//! `ATLAS_SKIP_BUILD` fallback in `avarok-kernels/build.rs` once the CLI ships
//! `AVAROK_*` names and no supported release still emits `ATLAS_*`.
