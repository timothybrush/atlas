//! Process-fatal GPU fault latch.
//!
//! # Why this exists (issue #429)
//!
//! A large class of CUDA errors — `CUDA_ERROR_MISALIGNED_ADDRESS` (716),
//! `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` (700), `CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED` (719) — are
//! **sticky**: they do not merely fail the call that produced them, they
//! destroy the CUDA *context*. Every subsequent driver call in the process
//! returns the same status, forever. There is no in-process recovery; the
//! context cannot be re-created while the primary context is retained.
//!
//! Before this module, Atlas treated such a failure as a per-request error.
//! The forward pass returned `Err`, the scheduler failed that batch, the
//! handler emitted a 500 — and then **kept serving**. `/health` still said
//! `ready`, because a model was still published, and every following request
//! died deep in the driver (observed at `cuMemsetD8Async`). The process was
//! alive, advertised itself as healthy, and could only produce errors.
//!
//! # How fatality is decided — probed, never guessed
//!
//! Classification does **not** match on the error code or its text. Sticky-ness
//! is a property of the *context*, so it is measured directly: after a failed
//! operation, issue a call that must succeed on a healthy context (a no-op
//! synchronize). If that also fails, the context is gone.
//!
//! This is why [`classify`] takes a probe *result* rather than an error code.
//! It buys three things a code allowlist cannot:
//!
//! - it covers every sticky status, including ones not yet enumerated;
//! - it does **not** kill the server for a status that merely *looks* fatal —
//!   an isolated `invalid argument` from a bad launch config leaves the
//!   context healthy, and the probe says so;
//! - it is a pure function of the probe, so both verdicts are unit-testable
//!   with no GPU.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! The latch is one-shot and first-writer-wins: the *first* fault is the
//! diagnostic one, and everything after it is that fault echoing through the
//! remaining call sites. Reporting the tenth `cuMemsetD8Async` failure instead
//! of the launch that poisoned the context would bury the cause.
//!
//! Both properties come from `OnceLock` rather than from code that maintains
//! them. A flag-plus-reason pair (`AtomicBool` + `Mutex<Option<String>>`) has a
//! window in which the flag is visible and the reason is not, and a health
//! endpoint that lands in it reports "faulted, reason unknown" — the least
//! useful of the three possible answers. A single `OnceLock<String>` makes
//! "is faulted" and "has a reason" the same word, so the window does not
//! exist and `set` supplies first-writer-wins atomically.
