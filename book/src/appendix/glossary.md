| **MODEL.toml** | Per-model metadata in `kernels/<hw>/<model>/`. Sampling presets, thinking budget, behavior defaults. |
| **MRoPE** | Multi-RoPE. Variant of RoPE that splits head dim into spatial (H, W) and temporal (T) segments. Used by vision models. |

| **NVFP4** | 4-bit E2M1 weights + FP8 E4M3 per-block scales (block=16). Atlas's flagship quant format on GB10. |
| **O_DIRECT** | Linux open flag that bypasses the page cache. Used by Atlas's fast safetensors loader. |
| **PCND** | "Prefer Config / No Defaults" — a user-instruction principle: no implicit defaults in production paths. |

| **RadixAttention** | Prefix-caching mechanism built on a radix tree over token sequences. |
| **RMSNorm** | Root-mean-square normalization. The norm used in every modern transformer Atlas supports. |
| **RoCE** | RDMA over Converged Ethernet. Atlas's multi-node transport. |
