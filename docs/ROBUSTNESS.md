# Certification pipeline robustness

An append-only record. One entry per wave: what was found, the evidence, what
changed, and — the part that matters — what the *negative control* proved.

A guard that has only ever been seen to pass is indistinguishable from a guard
that cannot fail, and the second kind is worse than no guard at all, because it
reports safety. So every entry here names the control and what it caught.

**The gate:** `bash .github/scripts/certification-selftest.sh` — offline, no
network, no GPU. It runs in the security job on every PR.

## Baseline — 2026-09-03

Before any of this work:

| Surface | Tested in CI? |
|---|---|
| `gate/signing.rs` | ✅ 12 Rust tests |
| `gate/card.rs` | ✅ 9 Rust tests |
| `seal-coverage.py` | ❌ none |
| `assert-cmd-runner-safe.py` | ❌ none |
| `render-certificate.py` | ❌ none |
| `certification-state.sh` | ❌ none |
| `pr-review.sh` | ❌ none |
| `ci.yml` stamp / seal / expedite logic | ❌ none |
| one-commit-one-signer step | ❌ none |

Open at baseline: PR #843 red on `PR benchmark gate` and `seal status` — both
expected (unstamped, unsealed), not defects.

---

## Wave 1 — the shell half had no tests at all

**Found.** The Rust half of the certification pipeline has 21 tests that run on
every PR. The shell and Python half — which decides who may stamp, who may seal,
whether the self-hosted runner can reach untrusted code, and whether a record
was signed — had **zero**. Every one of those guards had been verified once, by
hand, in a terminal, and then trusted permanently.

That is the highest-severity finding available here, because it is not a bug in
any one guard: it is the absence of anything that would notice a bug in any of
them.

**Changed.** Added `.github/scripts/certification-selftest.sh` — 19 checks, of
which **11 are negative controls** — and wired it into the security job, which
already runs on every PR, so this costs no new queue slot.

**The control proved it.** The suite was sabotaged four ways and watched go red:

| Sabotage | What went red |
|---|---|
| `seal-coverage.py` stops refusing unsupported CODEOWNERS patterns (fail-open regression) | all 3 fail-closed controls |
| `assert-cmd-runner-safe.py` blinded to head-ref checkouts | `control: checks out the PR head on the command runner` |
| `render-certificate.py` stops un-hiding co-author slots | `three authors -> 1 visible slots` |
| — | positives stayed green in every case |

The third reproduces a real bug shipped earlier in the day: co-authors were
silently dropped from a certificate that rendered and looked correct. It is now
impossible to reintroduce without CI saying so.

**A mistake worth recording.** The first sabotage attempt broke Python syntax
rather than behaviour, so the *positive* test failed and the fail-closed
controls stayed green. That looked like a caught regression and was not — it
proved only that the suite notices a file that will not parse. Sabotage has to
target the behaviour under test, or the control is theatre.

**Still open.** `certification-state.sh` and the `ci.yml` stamp/seal/expedite
shell have no coverage in the suite yet. The one-commit-one-signer step is
tested only in a scratch repo, by hand.

---

## Wave 2 — the gate itself was not portable

**Found.** CI went red on `cargo deny` — the job wave 1 had just added the
self-test to. Not a flake: the suite's three certificate-rendering checks failed
on `ubuntu-latest` because `render-certificate.py` imports `segno`, which had
been installed by hand on this box and on avarok but exists nowhere in CI.

The gate built to catch regressions was itself broken in a way that only CI
could see. Worth stating plainly: wave 1 reported "19 passed" from a machine
where the dependency happened to be present, and that number was true and
useless.

**Changed.** The suite now checks its prerequisites up front — `python3`, `jq`,
PyYAML, segno — and exits 2 with a named list if any are absent. The security
job installs them before running it.

**The control proved it.** With a shimmed `python3` that reports segno missing,
the suite exits **2** and names `python3-segno`, rather than running a reduced
set of checks and reporting success. With the prerequisites present it is 19/19
again.

The tempting fix was to skip the QR-dependent checks when segno is unavailable.
That would have turned a suite that *cannot run* into a suite that *reports
success* — the precise failure mode this file exists to prevent, reintroduced
inside the file itself.

**Still open.** Unchanged from wave 1: `certification-state.sh` and the
`ci.yml` stamp/seal/expedite shell have no coverage; the one-commit-one-signer
step is exercised only by hand.

---

## Wave 3 — a control that asserted an implementation detail

**Found.** With the dependency fixed, CI still failed — on the SIGPIPE control
itself, not on the code it guards. The pre-fix form exits **2 in CI** and **141
locally**: `jq` traps `EPIPE` and exits 2 with a diagnostic, while other builds
take the signal and die silently with 141. The control asserted `rc=141`, so it
passed on this box and failed on `ubuntu-latest`.

The guarded behaviour was correct on both machines the entire time. The control
was wrong.

**Two wrong fixes, both tried.** First `rc=141` → "non-zero **and** the output
mentions a broken pipe". That went red locally, where the process dies silently
and prints nothing. Pinning the *message* is the same mistake as pinning the
*code*: both are platform detail dressed up as an invariant.

**Changed.** The control now asserts the property that is actually invariant:
the **piped** form fails on the very input where the **unpiped** form, asserted
green one line above, succeeded. That isolates the pipe as the cause without
depending on how the platform reports it.

**The control proved it.** Substituting the fixed (unpiped) command in for the
"pre-fix" one turns that control red — so it is still measuring something. 19/19
locally.

**The lesson, since it generalises.** A negative control that pins an exit code
or an error string is testing the platform, not the property. Ask what would
still be true on a machine you have never used.

**Still open.** `certification-state.sh` and the `ci.yml` stamp/seal/expedite
shell remain uncovered. CI has not yet confirmed this wave.

---

## Wave 4 — the ci.yml decision logic, and a control that measured nothing

**Found.** Four shell blocks inside `ci.yml` decide whether anything merges
uncertified — the stamp verdict, the seal verdict, the alias that mirrors
certification into a required check, and the one-commit-one-signer step. They
live inside a workflow file, where nothing could execute them. None had ever
run outside a real CI job.

**Changed.** The suite now extracts each block from `ci.yml` with PyYAML and
runs it against a stubbed `gh`. 13 new checks, 7 of them controls. Total 32.

**The control proved it — and then failed to.** Three sabotages of `ci.yml`:

| Sabotage | Caught? |
|---|---|
| alias flips `WEB_ONLY = "true"` to `!= "false"` (the fail-open doctrine violation) | ✅ `control: a broken classifier (empty web_only) stays red` |
| stamp stops short-circuiting non-PR events (would wedge the merge queue) | ✅ `merge_group was held` |
| **one-commit step stops requiring a signature on added records** | ❌ **32/32, green** |

The third is the finding. The control asserted only `rc=1`, and several guards
in that step overlap: a record with no sidecar trips the signature check *and*
the one-signer check, because "no sidecar" reads as a distinct signer. Deleting
the guard under test left the suite green, because a different guard caught the
same fixture.

**A control that passes when the thing it tests has been deleted is measuring
nothing.** It is the exact failure this record exists to catch, and it was in a
check written one wave earlier specifically to catch such things.

**Fixed.** `want_rc_msg` pins the exit code *and* which guard fired. The three
one-commit controls now assert their own diagnostic — `Unsigned record added`,
`span more than one commit`, `more than one signer`. Re-running sabotage 3 now
fails correctly, naming the missing message.

**Still open.** `certification-state.sh` has no coverage. The seal job's
`merge_group` branch — which derives the PR number from a queue branch name — is
exercised only by hand.

---

## Wave 5 — the state machine, and two harness bugs that looked like results

**Found.** `certification-state.sh` picks one of eleven states from the PR's
merged flag, its mergeable_state, its queue entry and three check-run
conclusions. It is what the bot shows an author. Nothing tested it.

**Changed.** 11 checks driven by a stubbed `gh`, covering every stage the ladder
can reach plus the two precedence rules that outrank it. Total 43.

**Two of my own bugs, both of which first read as findings.**

*One.* Four state checks failed with empty output. The obvious reading was a
defect in the script. Running it directly showed it emitting `stage-1`
perfectly — the fault was my stub: `[ -n "$v" ] && echo "$v"` returns non-zero
on an empty value, so the stub exited 1 and every *absent check run* looked like
an *API failure*. Fixed by printing unconditionally. Had I trusted the first
reading, I would have "fixed" a script that was already correct.

*Two.* Sabotage B — forcing `has_seal=true` — showed the suite green at 43/43,
which reads as a hole. It was not. The anchor matched **zero** times: the real
line has two spaces after the semicolon and quotes around `success`. The
sabotage never applied. Re-run with an asserted anchor, it turns **four** checks
red, including both "a failed Seal is not a seal" controls.

A silently no-op'd sabotage is indistinguishable from an uncaught regression,
and both look like green. Assert the anchor before drawing the conclusion.

**The controls proved it.** Removing the merged-outranks-everything rule turns
`a merged PR reads merged` and `merged outranks a full stage-3 board` red.
Treating any Seal conclusion as a seal turns four red.

**Still open.** The seal job's `merge_group` branch — deriving a PR number from
a `gh-readonly-queue/<base>/pr-<N>-<sha>` branch name — is exercised only by
hand. `/expedite` has no end-to-end coverage; its `admin`-only refusal and its
required-reason refusal are both untested.

---

## Wave 6 — who may bypass the gate

**Found.** The command handlers decide who may release the expensive lane, who
may vouch for a diff, and — with `/expedite` — who may merge without proving
anything at all. None was tested. `/expedite` is the highest-consequence path in
the pipeline and had zero coverage from the moment it was written.

**Changed.** 11 checks, 8 of them controls, driven through a `gh` stub that
records every call. Total 54.

**The assertion that matters.** A refusal is not merely "prints a message" — a
refused command must create **no check run**. A refusal that still mints the
mark is cosmetic, and would be invisible in a log. Every control here asserts
both halves: a comment was posted *and* no `Stamp`/`Seal`/`Expedite` was minted.

**The controls proved it.** Three sabotages, each with an asserted anchor so a
silent no-op could not masquerade as a pass:

| Sabotage | What went red |
|---|---|
| `/expedite` accepts `write`/`maintain`, not just `admin` | `control: write access cannot expedite` |
| `/expedite` stops requiring a reason | both reason controls |
| `/seal` accepts authorship instead of write access | `control: authorship was accepted as a seal` |

The last is worth stating plainly: authorship and ownership are different
claims. A stamp says "this is ready to cost an hour of runners", which its
author is well placed to judge. A seal says "a codeowner has read this diff",
which its author is not. Conflating them would let anyone self-certify their own
work, and now that cannot regress silently.

**Still open.** The seal job's `merge_group` branch — deriving a PR number from
`gh-readonly-queue/<base>/pr-<N>-<sha>` — is exercised only by hand. `/help` and
`/review` have no coverage; both are low-consequence (they post text and cannot
change a verdict), which is why they are last.

---

## Wave 7 — the merge-queue seal path, and the hollow control again

**Found.** The seal job also runs inside the merge queue, where there is no
`pull_request` payload and the PR number must be recovered from a
GitHub-generated branch name, `gh-readonly-queue/<base>/pr-<N>-<sha>`. Wrong
here means either the queue deadlocks or an unsealed entry lands. Hand-tested
only.

**Changed.** 8 checks, 5 controls. Total 62.

**A wrong assertion of mine.** The first version asserted the recovered PR
number appears in the success output. It does not — the success path prints only
the sha. The number is named on the *failure* path, so the assertion moved
there: `PR #840` in the refusal proves both that the number was derived from the
branch and that the right PR was consulted. A wrong number would have looked up
someone else's seal and passed.

**The hollow control, a second time.** Sabotage A deleted the fail-closed branch
and the suite stayed green at 62/62. Not a safe outcome — an accident. With the
branch gone the script still exits 1, via
`[: REFUSE: integer expression expected` falling through to the generic "Not
sealed" message. Safe today, fragile tomorrow, and it tells the operator the
wrong thing: *"no seal"* when the truth is *"we could not look"*.

The control asserted `rc=1` and nothing else, so it could not tell a deliberate
refusal from an arithmetic crash. It now pins the message — `Could not read the
seal` — and re-running the sabotage fails correctly.

This is the same defect class as wave 4, found in a different file one wave
apart. The generalisation is worth stating: **when several paths can produce the
same exit code, asserting the exit code tests none of them.** Pin the
diagnostic.

**Still open.** `/help` and `/review` have no coverage. Both only post text and
cannot change a verdict, which is why they are last — but "cannot change a
verdict" is itself an untested claim.

---

## Wave 8 — "it cannot change a verdict" was an inspection, not a test

**Found.** `/help` and `/review` post text and mint nothing. That was true by
reading the file, which is exactly the kind of claim that stops being true
quietly. It matters more than it looks: `/review`'s permission check is
deliberately weak — anyone who can comment may ask it a question — because it
only posts prose. Give it the ability to create a check run and an outside
contributor could mint their own `Seal` by asking about the diff.

**Changed.** `.github/scripts/assert-command-authority.py`: only
`/stamp and /seal` and `/expedite` may POST a check run, re-run CI, or PATCH,
PUT or DELETE anything. It also pins the workflow to `permissions: {contents:
read}`, since every step inherits the top-level grant and none of them needs
more. 5 checks, 4 controls. Total 67.

**The controls proved it**, on synthetic workflows and then on the real one:

| Sabotage | Result |
|---|---|
| `/review` gains `POST .../check-runs -f name=Seal` (real file, anchor asserted) | ❌ refused |
| top-level permissions widened to `contents: write, checks: write` (real file) | ❌ refused |
| `/review` gains `/rerun` (synthetic) | ❌ refused |
| a text-only `/review` | ✅ passes |

**What this closes.** The three preceding waves tested whether a guard reaches
the right verdict. This one tests whether a command *has the authority to reach
a verdict at all* — a different question, and the one an attacker would ask
first. The permission checks in wave 6 only matter while the weakly-checked
commands stay powerless.

**Still open.** `pr-review.sh`'s own behaviour — its refusals on a missing key
or a non-200 — is untested; the harness would need to fake an OpenRouter
endpoint. The bot's state-comment editing (marker lookup, in-place PATCH) has no
coverage.

---

## Wave 9 — /review's refusals, and a stub that lost the message

**Found.** `pr-review.sh` refuses in three ways — no model id, no API key, a
non-200 from the endpoint — and every one of them exits **0** on purpose: a
`/review` that cannot reach a model must not fail anyone's CI. That makes the
exit code useless as an assertion, so all three had to be pinned by message.
None was tested.

**Changed.** 8 checks, 5 controls. Total 75.

**A harness bug that read as a script bug.** Five checks failed with "it never
explained itself". The script had explained itself perfectly: it posts with
`gh api ... -F body=@-`, so the message arrives on **stdin**, and my stub only
recorded argv. Third time this record notes the same shape — the first reading
of a red test was "the code is broken" and the truth was "the harness is".

**The controls proved it**, each with an asserted anchor:

| Sabotage | What went red |
|---|---|
| the missing-key guard removed — would call the endpoint with no credential | both the message check and `no key -> no request attempted` |
| a non-200 reported as success | `a 500 is reported, not swallowed` |
| the `UNTRUSTED` fence renamed | `PR prose is not fenced` |

The last is the one worth keeping. A PR's title and body are attacker-controlled
text that gets fed to a model. They are fenced between `UNTRUSTED` markers with
the system prompt told to treat anything inside as data. Remove the fence and a
PR title becomes an instruction — and the guard now notices.

**Still open.** The bot's state-comment editing — finding its own comment by the
`<!-- atlas-certification-state:… -->` marker and PATCHing it in place — has no
coverage. That is the last uncovered path.

---

## Wave 10 — the bot's comment lifecycle, and two hollow assertions of mine

**Found.** The bot keeps ONE comment and edits it in place, except on merge,
where it posts a second one — because GitHub does not notify on an `@mention`
added by *editing* a comment, so tagging the authors in the edited comment would
alert nobody. It also fires on `check_run` completions *after* a merge, so
without an idempotency guard a contributor is tagged once per event. None of it
was tested. This was the last uncovered path.

**Changed.** 6 checks, 4 controls. Total 81.

**Two hollow assertions, both mine, both found by the checks disagreeing.**

*One.* `certed()` grepped the recorded calls for `atlas-certificate`. The
idempotency **query** contains that literal string inside its `--jq` filter, so
the helper matched the *lookup* and reported a certificate that was never
posted. It could not distinguish "asked whether one exists" from "posted one".
Now it requires a `POST` to the comments endpoint carrying the marker.

*Two.* With that fixed, the positive went red: "merged -> no certificate". The
bot was right again. My `rsvg-convert` stub was a no-op that produced no file,
so the `sha256sum` naming it failed and `set -euo pipefail` aborted the step
before the POST. A stub that does not produce its output is not a stub, it is a
different failure.

That is the fourth time in this record that a red check meant the harness was
wrong, not the code. The pattern is consistent enough to state as a rule: **when
a new test fails against code that has been working, suspect the test first.**

**The controls proved it**, each anchor-asserted:

| Sabotage | What went red |
|---|---|
| the certificate loses its once-only guard | `a certificate already posted is not posted again` |
| the bot posts instead of editing | `an existing comment is edited, not duplicated` |
| the certificate is posted regardless of state | `a certificate was posted for a PR that has not merged` |

**Coverage is now complete.** Every gate, command and bot path in the
certification pipeline has at least one check and at least one negative control
proven able to fail: seal coverage, runner safety, certificate rendering,
pr-review truncation and refusals, the stamp/seal/alias/one-commit decision
logic, the eleven-state machine, command permissions, command authority, the
merge-queue seal path, and the bot's comment lifecycle.

**Still open.** Nothing structural. The suite runs offline, so it cannot catch a
defect that only appears against the real GitHub API — the App's token
permissions, for instance, are asserted nowhere and would fail only in
production.

---

## Wave 11 — the offline gap: is the App still allowed to act?

**Found.** Wave 10 closed the last *logic* path and named what remained: the
suite runs offline, so it proves the pipeline decides correctly but not that it
is still permitted to act. Every write goes through an installation token, and
an App whose grant narrows — an org policy, an edit to the App, a permission
added to the manifest and never accepted — keeps working right up until someone
types `/stamp`.

Worse, several of those failures are **silent by design**. The bot swallows API
errors so a broken lookup cannot fail a contributor's CI; the certificate step
treats an unreadable comments API as "already posted". Both are correct
behaviours, and both are exactly why a permission regression would go unnoticed
until a release was blocked.

**Changed.** `certification-preflight.yml` probes each permission with the
smallest real call that needs it — weekly and on demand. It names *why* each
one matters, so a failure says what will break rather than which endpoint
returned 403:

    pull_requests:read   /stamp resolves the head sha and the author
    checks:read          every gate reads Stamp, Seal and Expedite
    issues:read          the bot finds its own comment by marker
    members:read         /stamp and /seal check who is asking
    actions:read         /stamp re-runs the held CI run
    contents:read        the bot-cards branch hosts generated certificates
    checks:write         /stamp, /seal and /expedite mint their marks

`checks:write` is probed for real, by creating a check run named "Certification
preflight". Without it the three commands that mint marks are all dead, which is
the whole pipeline. A check run is additive and self-describing, so the probe
costs one line in the checks list and leaves nothing to clean up.

**The control proved it.** All six read probes pass against the live API with a
valid token, and **all six fail** with an invalid one — so the probes are
reaching GitHub rather than passing vacuously.

**Why this is not in the self-test.** It needs the network and a real App token,
which the offline suite deliberately does not have. Running it per-PR would also
add a check run to every PR for no benefit. Weekly catches a grant that was
narrowed; on-demand covers the case where someone has just edited the App.

**Still open.** Nothing known. The pipeline's logic has 81 offline checks with
50 controls, and its authority now has a live probe with a control. What is not
covered — and cannot be, short of a staging org — is GitHub changing the
semantics of an endpoint underneath us.

---

## Wave 12 — the guard on the guard

**Found.** Eighty-one checks and fifty controls hang on **one line in one
workflow**. Delete that line and every one of them stops running — silently,
with `cargo deny`, the job it lived in, still green. Ten waves of work,
removable in a one-line diff nobody would notice in review.

The good half: `cargo deny` *is* a required context, so a **failing** suite does
block a merge. The gap was never enforcement of the result; it was enforcement
of the **wiring**.

**Why it could not go in the suite.** If the step is removed the suite never
executes, so a check inside it can never fire. A guard cannot notice its own
absence. It has to live somewhere that still runs.

**Changed.** `assert-selftest-wired.py`, hosted in the **LoC-cap job** — a
different required context. Removing the suite from `security.yml` now breaks
`Enforce ≤500 LoC per source file` instead. It asserts two things: that some job
invokes the suite, and that the job reports under a name branch protection
requires — because a suite in a job nobody has to pass is a suite that can be
ignored.

**The controls proved it**, both anchor-asserted:

| Sabotage | Result |
|---|---|
| the self-test step deleted from `security.yml` | ❌ *"nothing runs certification-selftest.sh"* |
| the suite moved to a non-required job | ❌ *"runs, but only in non-required job(s)"* |

**On the literal in that file.** `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS = {"cargo deny"}` is
hardcoded, because the assertion must work without network access. If branch
protection changes, that line is what needs updating — and the failure message
says exactly that rather than leaving someone to guess.

**Still open.** Nothing known. This wave closed the last structural gap I can
name: the pipeline's logic is covered offline, its authority is probed live, and
its wiring is now guarded from a job that cannot be removed in the same edit.

---

## Wave 13 — the Rust tests were trusted the way the shell was before wave 1

**Found.** `gate/signing.rs` and `gate/card.rs` have 21 tests that run on every
PR, and this record has leaned on that fact since wave 1 to argue the Rust half
was covered. Not one of them had ever been **shown to fail**. That is exactly
the position the shell half was in before any of this started, one level up:
green tests, trusted because they are green.

**Changed.** Nothing in the code. Three sabotages, to find out whether the
existing tests measure anything.

| Sabotage | Caught by |
|---|---|
| signature verification always succeeds | `editing_the_record_breaks_the_signature`, `a_record_cannot_be_repointed_at_another_commit`, `a_signature_from_another_record_does_not_transfer` |
| `sig_path` uses `with_extension("sig")` | `the_sidecar_path_appends_and_does_not_eat_a_versioned_model_name`, `no_committed_record_escapes_the_cutover_unsigned` |
| card formats a metric to 3 decimals instead of 1 | `formats_round_the_way_a_reader_expects` |

All three caught, by the tests written for them. The Rust half is genuinely
covered — now demonstrated rather than assumed.

**A sabotage of mine that was inert, and why it matters.** The first attempt at
the `sig_path` bug used `with_extension("json.sig")`. On
`…-qwen3.8-27b.json` that yields `…-qwen3.8-27b.json.sig` — byte-identical to
appending. The suite stayed green and I very nearly recorded an uncovered path.
It was not one: the sabotage did not change behaviour. The real bug is
`with_extension("sig")`, which produces `…-qwen3.8-27b.sig` and is caught
immediately.

Twice now a green result has meant "my sabotage did nothing" rather than "the
guard is missing" — wave 5 with a non-matching anchor, and here with a matching
anchor that made no behavioural difference. **Asserting the anchor is necessary
and not sufficient. Check that the edit changes what the code does.**

**Still open.** Nothing known. Every layer — shell logic, Rust logic, live
authority, and the wiring that runs it all — has now been shown to fail when the
thing it guards is broken.

---

## Wave 14 — landing it, and the pipeline exercising itself

**Found.** Thirteen waves of guards protect nothing while they sit on a branch.
The suite gates `main` only once it is *on* `main`.

**Changed.** Nothing new. `/stamp` and `/seal` on #843, dispatched against the
branch's own workflow so they ran on the self-hosted runner the PR introduces.

**The measurement.** Both marks recorded in **47 seconds** for two commands.
Earlier the same day, on hosted runners, a single `/stamp` waited **220
minutes**. Same repo, same commands, same account.

That number is the point of the runner change, and it is now demonstrated by the
change certifying itself rather than by a benchmark written to flatter it.

**What this wave actually proves.** The pipeline ran its own three stages on the
PR that hardens it: `/seal` verified codeowner coverage across the diff,
`/stamp` released the held lane, both marks landed on the head, and the 81-check
suite plus the wiring guard ran as required contexts on the same commit.

**Still open.** Nothing known. The record's last entry is the merge itself.

---

## Wave 15 — #843 merged, and the merge exposed a real defect

**#843 merged** at 21:10:18Z as `dc6dd82a31`. The suite, the wiring guard, the
authority assertion and the preflight are all on `main`, and the guard confirms
the suite still runs in a required job.

**The bot answered the merge in 3 seconds** and finished in 25, on the
self-hosted runner. It posted the first certificate this pipeline has ever
produced — #836 and #840 could not certificate themselves, because a
comment-handler workflow runs from the default branch *as it was when the event
fired*, and the machinery was landing in those very merges.

**Then the verification found a defect.** The certificate comment shipped a
broken image: `bot-cards/pr-843-112aac4b.png` is a **404**. `rsvg-convert` and
`segno` are both present on avarok, the branch exists — but it still contains
only `README.md`. The upload never happened, almost certainly for want of
`contents: write`, and the PUT is deliberately non-fatal so that a missing grant
cannot swallow the certificate itself. Non-fatal made it **silent**.

**Two fixes, because there were two defects.**

*The bot* now checks the object exists before linking it, and falls back to the
committed generic certificate with a `::warning` when it does not. A generic
image is worse than a bespoke one; a 404 is worse than both.

*The preflight* — the guard I built in wave 11 specifically to catch permission
gaps — probed `contents:read` and **never `contents:write`**, which is the
permission that actually failed. It now performs a real write to `bot-cards` and
deletes the probe file afterwards.

**The control proved it.** A new suite check drives the bot with a stub whose
contents lookup fails and asserts the comment does not reference the missing
object. Reverting the bot to link unconditionally turns it red. 82 checks now.

**The lesson.** Wave 11 asserted every permission the pipeline *reads* and one
it writes, and I recorded it as closing the offline gap. It closed most of it.
The write that mattered was the one I did not think to probe — and the failure
mode I had designed in (non-fatal upload) is exactly what hid it. **A guard
built from your own model of the system inherits the blind spots of that model.
Only running the real thing found this.**

**Still open.** The App very likely lacks `contents: write` on this repo. The
preflight will now say so on its next run; granting it is a change to the App's
permissions that a human has to accept.

---

## Wave 16 — the probe confirmed the diagnosis

**Ran the new preflight against the live App.** It reports exactly what wave 15
predicted from the 404 alone:

    ok    pull_requests:read     /stamp resolves the head sha and the author
    ok    checks:read            every gate reads Stamp, Seal and Expedite
    ok    issues:read            the bot finds its own comment by marker
    ok    members:read           /stamp and /seal check who is asking
    ok    actions:read           /stamp re-runs the held CI run
    ok    contents:read          the bot-cards branch hosts generated certificates
    FAIL  contents:write         certificate images CANNOT be uploaded
    ok    checks:write           /stamp, /seal and /expedite mint their marks

So the certification App has every permission the pipeline needs **except**
`contents: write`, and that single gap is exactly what made #843's certificate
ship a broken image. Nothing else is affected: `/stamp`, `/seal` and `/expedite`
all mint their marks, because `checks:write` is present.

**What this closes.** The defect is understood, the code no longer posts a
broken link, and the guard that missed it now catches it — verified by running
it rather than by reasoning about it. Everything in this record that can be
fixed in code has been.

**What only a human can do.** Granting `contents: write` to the certification
App is a change to the App's repository permissions, accepted in the GitHub UI.
Until then the certificate falls back to the generic image and the preflight
stays red — deliberately, because a red check that names a real missing grant is
the correct state, not something to paper over.

---

## Wave 17 — the fix verified in production, and where this stops

**#846 merged** at 22:47:51Z as `1415fc5e14`, and the fix is confirmed against
the real bot rather than a stub:

    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/docs/diagrams/states/certificate-merged.png"
    HTTP/2 200

The certificate on #846 links the committed generic image and **resolves**,
where #843's linked a generated object that was never uploaded and returned 404.
The bot also emitted the warning it was given: *"Certificate image was not
uploaded ... The App likely lacks contents:write."* Correct behaviour, correctly
explained, in production.

## Where this stops, and why

**The goal is met for everything reachable in code.** Every gate, command and
bot path in the certification pipeline has at least one check and at least one
negative control that has been *watched to fail*:

| Layer | Proven by |
|---|---|
| shell/Python logic — 82 checks | 20+ sabotages |
| ci.yml decisions, state machine, permissions, authority | 15 sabotages |
| Rust logic — 21 tests | 3 sabotages |
| live App authority — 8 permissions | an invalid-token control, and one real gap it caught |
| suite wiring | 2 sabotages, guarded from a different required job |

**Six of the seventeen findings were defects in the verification, not the
pipeline** — hollow controls that passed with the guard deleted, sabotages that
were inert, harness bugs that read as code bugs. Those are the entries worth
re-reading, because they are the failure mode that survives a green suite.

**One real production defect was found**: #843's certificate shipped a broken
image, caused by a permission gap the preflight had not thought to probe. Fixed,
with a control, and the probe now covers it.

**What is still open, and cannot be closed from here.** The certification App
lacks `contents: write`. The preflight reports it, the bot degrades safely
around it, and granting it is a change to the App's repository permissions that
a person accepts in the GitHub UI. Until then certificates carry the generic
image.

**What can never be closed.** The suite runs offline and the probe runs against
one repo. Neither can catch GitHub changing an endpoint's semantics underneath
us. That is a limit, not an oversight, and it is written here so nobody later
mistakes this record for a claim of completeness.

---

## Wave 18 — a suite that reported for months and gated nothing (#810)

**Found.** Not by sweeping for a mechanism, but by reading the open issues:
#810 had already written the defect down. `Site unit tests` ran on every pull
request and on every merge-queue entry, reported green, and blocked neither the
merge nor the deploy. Two independent reasons, and fixing either alone would
have left the other:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| required contexts on `main` | 19, none of them the site suite | 20 |
| `deploy` needs | `build` | `[build, unit]` |

The issue notes what this cost: a latching-state regression (#805) reached
`main` and was only caught later, in the window when the suite could not import
a `.svelte.js` rune module at all.

**Verified.** Three consecutive `site.yml` runs on three different PR branches
each show `Site unit tests: success` alongside `Deploy to avarok via rsync:
skipped` — the suite was demonstrably running and demonstrably not consulted.

**Fixed.** `deploy` now needs `unit` as well as `build`, and `Site unit tests`
was added to branch protection through the additive contexts endpoint rather
than a full `PATCH`, so the other nineteen contexts and every unrelated setting
could not be clobbered by a malformed payload. Diffed before and after: one
context added, none removed, the rest of the protection object identical.

**Proved, and proved the proof.** `assert-site-tests-gate.py` was written and
run *before* the fix, against the unfixed tree, where it refused. It is hosted
in `certification-selftest.sh` — a required context — rather than in the site's
own lane, because a suite cannot be relied on to notice it has been unwired
from itself. Four controls, each pinning the message and not just the exit code
(three distinct defects leave through the same `fail()`, so an exit code alone
distinguishes none of them): drop `unit` from `deploy`'s needs, give `unit` an
`if:`, give `pull_request` a `paths:` filter, delete `unit` outright.

**The third control failed on first run, and was right to.** YAML 1.1 parses a
bare `on:` key as the boolean `True`, so `d["on"]` raised `KeyError` and the
sabotage never applied — the guard then passed, and the control went red for
exactly the right reason. This is the wave 5 failure recurring in a new
disguise: a sabotage that does not land makes green mean nothing. It was caught
here only because the control asserted the guard *must* fail; had it been
written the usual way round, an inert edit would have read as a passing test.

**Why the second assertion exists.** Requiring a context is only safe if the
job reports on *every* PR — a job held behind an `if:` is never created for the
PRs it skips, and GitHub waits on it forever. Five workflows in this repo carry
that scar. So the guard also refuses if `unit` grows an `if:` or a `needs:`, or
if `site.yml`'s `pull_request` trigger grows a `paths:` filter. The fix and the
thing that makes the fix dangerous are pinned in the same file.

**Also this wave.** Closed #839 as a duplicate of #835 — my own issue, filed a
day after an existing one describing the same C=2 bimodality. The measurements
were moved onto #835 before closing, so consolidating cost no evidence.

**What is still open.** The branch-protection half is not expressible in the
tree, so no committed file can guard it; if someone removes the context, only
this record and the API say it was ever there.

---

## Wave 19 — the same defect, one workflow over: the guard's self-test was required, the guard was not

**Found by propagating, not by luck.** Wave 18 fixed one instance; step 6 of a
wave is to ask where else the *mechanism* lives. Sweeping every workflow for
jobs that run on pull requests but are neither a required context nor depended
upon by another job returned ten, of which one was the same defect with a
sharper edge:

| job | reports as | required? |
|---|---|---|
| `self-test` | Merge-ancestry guard self-test | **yes** |
| `guard` | PR shares history with its base | **no** |

The test that proves the guard *can* fail was mandatory. The guard's verdict on
your actual branch was advisory. A PR of the #452 class — an orphan branch whose
root commit is a whole-tree snapshot, which GitHub reports as `MERGEABLE`
because it computes mergeability over trees rather than ancestry, and whose
squash-merge silently reverts everything before it — would have gone red on
`guard` and merged regardless.

**Why it was advisory, and why that was not fixable by simply requiring it.**
`guard` carried `if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'`, because it read
`github.event.pull_request.*`. A merge-queue entry has no such payload, so the
job would never be created there, the required context would never appear, and
every queue entry would block forever. The `if:` was load-bearing. Requiring the
context without removing it would have converted a silent gap into an outage.

**Fixed** by resolving the pair per event: `pull_request` from the payload
(base re-resolved from `origin/<base.ref>`, since `base.sha` is the tip at PR
*creation* and goes stale), `merge_group` from `merge_group.base_sha`/`head_sha`,
and `workflow_dispatch` reporting success with a notice — it carries neither
pair, and a red there would assert "unrelated histories", which is a different
claim than "nothing to compare". In the queue the answer is trivially yes; that
foregone report is the price of the verdict being enforceable on the events
where it is not foregone, and the comment in the workflow says so.

**Proved twice, at two levels.** The workflow-level guard from wave 18 was
generalised from one hard-coded site check into a declarative table
(`assert-gates-are-wired.py`) rather than copied — the second instance was
found *by* generalising it, since the new entry refused on an unmodified tree.
Seven controls now, each pinning the message and not just the exit code:
dropping `unit` from `deploy`'s needs, an `if:` on the site suite, a `paths:`
filter, deleting the suite, restoring the ancestry guard's `if:`, dropping the
`merge_group` trigger, and **renaming a required job** — the quietest failure of
the set, since the job still runs and still passes while reporting under a name
branch protection is not waiting for.

Separately, the guard's own `run:` block was extracted and driven through all
three events against real commits, then against a purpose-built orphan: the
`merge_group` path exits 1 with `NO MERGE BASE`. Without that last step the
three green runs would only have shown the path executes, not that it can
still refuse.

**What is still open.** Requiring `PR shares history with its base` must wait
until this change is on `main` — the queue leg does not exist until then, and
requiring a context before the job that produces it can deadlock the queue.
Sequencing, not oversight; it is the last step of this wave and is recorded
here so that an unrequired context later is read as a regression rather than
the intended state.

---

## Wave 20 — the stamp that stamped nothing

**Found by using the pipeline, not by reading it.** `/stamp` on #847 minted a
green `Stamp` check in 39 seconds, and the benchmark gate stayed red saying
*"Comment /stamp to release certification"* — which had just been done. The
handler's own comment says it: **"★ A stamp that does not RE-RUN anything is a
stamp that does nothing."** It was doing nothing.

Three defects, stacked, each hiding the next:

| # | defect | why it was invisible |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the App installation lacks `actions: write` | no probe covered it |
| 2 | the preflight probed `actions:**read**` | its justification read "/stamp re-runs the held CI run" — a *write* |
| 3 | the re-run's stderr went to `/dev/null` | the reason was destroyed at the moment it was produced |

The third is what cost the time. `gh api -X POST .../rerun >/dev/null 2>&1 ||
echo "could not re-run"` reports that something failed and discards what. The
diagnosis needed a token comparison — my own PAT re-runs the same run with
`rc=0` — to establish what the log had thrown away.

**This is #843 one endpoint family over.** There, `contents:write` was absent,
the certificate upload is non-fatal by design, and the preflight probed
`contents:read`. Same shape, same silence, and the lesson had not propagated
from `contents` to `actions`.

**Fixed.** The re-run's stderr is captured and surfaced three ways: an `::error`
annotation, a `> [!WARNING]` block appended to the PR comment carrying the
verbatim API response, and a non-zero exit so the command job is red. The mark
is still recorded first — a stamp survives new commits and is worth keeping even
when the re-run fails — but the command no longer reports success for work it
did not do. The preflight's three hand-rolled write probes became one
`probe_write` helper, and `actions:write` joined them, probed by enabling an
already-enabled workflow: idempotent, needs the permission, and this very
workflow is provably enabled because it is the one running.

**Proved against history, which is the only control that counts here.**
`assert-preflight-covers-writes.py` derives, from the workflows themselves,
every write call that *swallows its own failure*, and requires a `probe_write`
for each. Run against the tree as it stood at `HEAD` — before any of this
wave's edits — it refuses on **both** `actions:write` and `contents:write`.
It would have caught #843 and #847 alike, on the day each was written.

Its scope is deliberately narrow and the file says why: a write that fails
*loudly* under `set -e` announces itself the first time it breaks, and demanding
a probe for it would mean inventing noisy probes (posting and deleting comments,
creating labels) for failures that are already self-announcing. Only suppressed
writes are pinned. Widening it would be the busywork the guard exists to
displace.

**Five controls, and the joining one matters.** Losing either `probe_write` is
caught — and the `contents:write` case doubles as proof that the guard rejoins
backslash continuations, since that PUT spans five lines with its `||` on the
last. Matched line-by-line it would read as *unsuppressed*, and the guard would
have passed by construction. Three more drive the extracted `/stamp` step with a
stubbed `gh` whose re-run returns 403: the step must exit non-zero, the comment
must say the lane was not released, and it must carry the API's own words.
Reverting the fix turns all three red; that was checked, not assumed.

**What is still open, and needs a person.** The App must be granted
`actions: write` (and still `contents: write`) and the installation must accept
both. Until then `/stamp` records a mark, posts the warning, and goes red — the
honest behaviour, but the lane still needs a manual re-run or any new commit.

---

## Wave 21 — a stray `set -e` had been silently truncating this suite

**The wave's own tooling was the first defect it found.** The vhost controls
added below reported nothing at all: the suite stopped after 97 checks with exit
1 and no summary line. Cause: the `/stamp` control added in wave 20 ended with
`set -e` to "restore" state that never existed — this suite runs `set -uo
pipefail`, with errexit deliberately **off**, because every control in it runs a
command that is *supposed* to fail. The first such control after that line
killed the run.

For one wave, `certification-selftest.sh` was a suite that stopped a quarter of
the way through and looked like an ordinary failure. Same non-zero status, no
summary, thirty checks silently not run — including every control this wave was
adding. It is the exact defect this whole record is about, committed by the file
whose job is to catch it.

**Fixed** by removing the stray `set -e`, and then by making the failure
impossible to miss: the EXIT trap now reports `SUITE TRUNCATED: exited after N
checks, before the summary` unless the summary was reached. Reintroducing the
`set -e` prints it after 97 checks — verified, not assumed.

**Then the wave proper.** Three public vhosts, one nginx rule, three separate
incidents, each found by hand after the fact:

| vhost | what was lost | how |
|---|---|---|
| docs | every HTML doc served with no security headers at all | `Cache-Control` inside `location ~* \.html$` |
| site | `Alt-Svc` on every proxied response; the dotfile refusal went out bare | headers inside `location /` |
| site | `Referrer-Policy`, which the other two sent | drift nobody was watching for |

`add_header` does not accumulate across contexts: a location declaring *any*
`add_header` discards every one inherited from the server block. All three were
fixed reactively. Nothing stopped a fourth.

`assert-vhost-headers.py` pins four things: the core set is declared at *server*
level in every vhost; no `add_header` appears inside any location at all
(refusing the construct outright, rather than reasoning about which uses would
be safe — per-path values belong in a `map`, which is how blog and docs compute
Cache-Control today); the core set is identical across the three; and
`X-XSS-Protection`, if present, is exactly `"0"`.

**One live defect fixed.** `atlasinference.io` was serving
`x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block` — confirmed by request, and absent from the
other two. The header is deprecated, every current browser has removed the
auditor it controls, and OWASP's Secure Headers Project recommends `"0"`
because the legacy filter is itself exploitable. Set to `"0"` rather than
deleted: with no header at all a legacy browser falls back to its default, which
is the filter **on**.

**Controls.** Four, each pinning the message. The docs incident is
reconstructed rather than replayed, and the file says so — that vhost has a
single commit, so its pre-fix text is not in the tree and there was nothing
honest to replay against. The sabotage harness asserts the edit actually
changed the file before trusting the result, which caught one control whose
escaping produced a Python `SyntaxError` instead of an edit.

**Not pinned, deliberately: HSTS.** None of the three sends
`Strict-Transport-Security`. That is a real gap, but a browser caches HSTS for
`max-age`, and choosing that value — and whether to preload — is a policy
decision for a person, not a default a linter installs. Raised, not taken.

**Two areas dug and found clean**, recorded so they are not re-dug: 115
`#[ignore]`d Rust tests are all documented GPU tests and the `--ignored` lane in
`kernel-compile.yml` genuinely executes 7 of them (`running 6 tests` /
`running 1 test` in the log, not a hollow `ok`); and there are no skipped JS
tests and no tautological assertions anywhere in the tree.

---

## Wave 22 — one dig found nothing, the next found a required check that is structurally blind

**First dig: the Rust half of the gate. Nothing found, and that is the result.**
The hypothesis was that `scoring.rs` (which decides whether a measured value
passes its bound) and `record_path.rs` had no tests — a first grep for
`scoring::` in the test files returned zero. That grep was wrong: both modules
are re-exported through `record.rs`, so tests call `check_record` and `date_of`
unprefixed. `scoring::check_record` has three named tests, `date_of` has one,
and every gate module but `check_fmt.rs` (27 lines, no public functions) is
exercised. Recorded here so it is not re-dug, and because a hypothesis that
survives one grep and dies on the second is worth writing down as a warning
about the first grep.

**Second dig: the security alert every push in this session printed.**
`GHSA-rhfx-m35p-ff5j` — `lru < 0.16.3`, `IterMut` violating Stacked Borrows —
was open against `main`'s lockfile.

The interesting part is not the crate. It is that **`cargo deny` is a required
context, it runs `check advisories`, it was green, and the advisory was open on
the same lockfile.** Not a misconfiguration: `cargo deny` resolves against
RustSec, Dependabot resolves against the GitHub Advisory Database, and this
advisory carries a GHSA id and **no RUSTSEC id**. No configuration of
`cargo deny` can see it. A green `cargo deny` is therefore not the claim
"no known advisory affects this lockfile", which is how a required check named
`cargo deny` reads.

**Exposure, established rather than assumed.** `lru` is not a direct dependency
of anything in the workspace; it enters twice-removed through `ratatui 0.29`.
Its only use there is `type Cache = LruCache<(Rect, Layout), (Segments,
Spacers)>` in `layout/layout.rs`, and the methods called on it are `cap()`,
`get()` and `resize()`. That file contains **zero** occurrences of `iter_mut`,
and `tui-textarea` — the other path to `ratatui` — does not depend on `lru` at
all. The advisory is about `lru::IterMut` specifically, so the vulnerable
iterator is never constructed in this graph. The alert is dismissed as
`not_used` with that reasoning and the condition for re-opening it (a ratatui
bump that iterates the cache mutably, or `lru` becoming direct).

**No guard was added, deliberately.** The honest options were a fragile one —
re-checking a vendored dependency's source in CI, which breaks the moment
ratatui is bumped and would fail for the wrong reason — or a CI step reading
the Dependabot alerts API, which needs a token permission this repo's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` does not carry, and there are already two permission grants
waiting on a person. Adding a third that sits red would be worse than the gap.
What was added instead is the blind spot written into `deny.toml` itself, beside
the `db-urls` line that causes it, so the next reader of that file learns it
there rather than by discovering an open alert behind a green check.

**Open, and a decision for a person:** whether to gate on Dependabot alerts at
all. Today they report on the default branch and block nothing.

---

## Wave 23 — two more capabilities that fail silently, found by sweeping for suppressed failure

**The sweep.** Every workflow step line ending in `|| true`, and every
`continue-on-error`. Twelve `|| true` lines; ten are benign (optional file
copies, diagnostic `ls`, apt fallbacks that nothing depends on). Two were not.

**Defect 1 — a missing render tool swallowed the whole certificate.**
`certification-bot.yml` installs `librsvg2-bin` and `segno` with `|| true`, then
runs `rsvg-convert` under `set -euo pipefail` with **no check that the install
worked**. If apt failed, the step died *before* the comment POST: a merged PR
got no certificate **and no comment at all**. The design three lines below
already states the rule it was breaking — a missing `contents:write` "cannot
swallow the certificate itself", which is exactly what a missing renderer did.

Fixed with a `render_ok` guard: absent tools now emit a warning, skip the
render, and fall through to the generic image that the fallback already exists
to serve. Degrade the picture, never the certificate.

**The control had to manufacture the absence.** This host has both tools
installed, so "the tool happens to be missing" would be the wave-2 mistake — a
control that only holds on one machine. It runs the extracted step against a
PATH containing the stubs plus a symlink farm of the commands the step actually
uses, resolved with `command -v` at runtime so it adapts to wherever they live,
and it asserts the farm did not leak `rsvg-convert` before trusting the result.
Reverting the guard turns both new controls red.

**Defect 2 — `/seal` minted its mark and never refreshed the job that reads it.**
This is wave 20's defect in the other verb, and it was live on this very PR:
`Seal` went green in 33 s while `seal status` stayed red. `ci.yml` has no
`check_run` trigger, so minting a check run does not re-evaluate anything, and
the re-run block was `if [ "$VERB" = "/stamp" ]`. The only way to refresh
`seal status` was to push a commit — **which is the one thing that voids a
seal**. The handler's own maxim, written for stamps, was never applied to the
verb next to it.

Re-running is safe for a seal: it adds no commit, and a seal is voided by
commits, not by CI runs.

**One existing control went red, correctly.** Rewording the warning from "the
held lane was not released" to "CI was not re-run" — necessary, since it now
covers both verbs — broke a control that pinned the old wording. That is a
message-pinned assertion doing its job: it noticed the text it depends on
changed, which is the behaviour that distinguishes it from asserting an exit
code six defects share.

**Not a defect, checked and recorded:** `coverage.yml`'s and `coderag.yml`'s
`continue-on-error: true` are deliberate and documented at their call sites, and
`ci.yml:1062` records that a previous one was made enforcing.

---

## Wave 24 — four sweeps found nothing, the fifth found dead links, and my own tooling was wrong twice

**Four digs, empty, recorded so they are not repeated:**

| swept | scale | result |
|---|---|---|
| jobs that never execute on a PR | 19 found | all legitimately post-merge (deploy/publish) or `workflow_call`ed from CI |
| shell syntax in every workflow `run:` | 147 blocks, 24 workflows | clean |
| shell syntax in standalone scripts | 55 scripts | clean |
| Python in `.github/scripts` | 10 files | clean |
| scripts a workflow invokes but that do not exist | 20 paths | none missing |

**The fifth found something, and the sweep that found it was mostly wrong.**
A markdown link sweep reported nineteen broken links. **Seventeen were bugs in
the sweep**: it stripped the leading dot from `.github`, and it resolved
site-root URLs like `/images/...` against the filesystem instead of against the
static directory the tree publishes. Both were caught by checking the findings
before believing them — the blog images exist under `blog/static/`, and `/api/`
is assembled at deploy time by `docs.yml` (`cp -a target/doc/. book/output/api/`)
and cannot be in the tree.

The two survivors are real: `docs/lora-implementation-status.md` linked to
`lora-mvp-proposal.md` and `lora-codebase-brief.md`, **neither of which has ever
existed in this repository's history**. Dead the day the file was committed.
Removed; the sentence carried nothing else.

**The guard is written for precision, not coverage, because of the above.**
A link checker that cries wolf gets muted or deleted, so
`assert-doc-links.py` is explicit about every root it knows —
`blog/**` → `blog/static`, `site/**` → `site/static`, `/api/**` generated — and
refuses loudly on a site-root link from a tree with no known static root rather
than skipping it. It reports 199 links, all resolving, with no false positives.

**Five controls, and two of them exist to catch vacuous passing.** Real breakage
caught; a site-root link whose target is deleted must also be caught (if
site-root links were *skipped* rather than resolved, the checker would pass
trivially and look identical); an unknown-tree site-root link must be loud, not
silent; and `/api/` must NOT be flagged, or every PR fails forever. Run against
the defect as it stood on `main`, the checker refuses with both links named.

**Note on this wave's honesty.** Two of my own checkers were wrong within one
wave — the path-stripping bug and the site-root bug — and in both cases the
error was found by checking a suspicious finding rather than by reading the
code. Nineteen findings, two real, is a 10% precision rate for a first-pass
sweep, and that ratio is the argument for verifying findings before acting on
them, not after.

---

## Wave 25 — licence drift I caused, and a check on the gate I made required

**Defect 1, and four of the six were mine.** `.github/scripts` had a real but
unenforced convention: 11 of 17 files carried an SPDX header. The six without
were the four scripts added during this record's own waves, plus
`harvest-triage.sh` and its test. `.licenserc.yaml` covered only
`crates/**/*.rs` and the CUDA trees, so nothing noticed.

Headers added, and the convention promoted from custom to gate by adding
`.github/scripts/*.{sh,py}` to `.licenserc.yaml`. `scripts/` is deliberately
**not** included: 12 of 95 files there carry a header, so there is no convention
to enforce and sweeping it in would be an 83-file change dressed as a lint.

**The control has two halves, and the second is the one that matters.** Removing
a header makes `check_spdx.py` exit 1 and name the file. Then, with the header
still removed but the `.licenserc.yaml` line reverted, the same missing header
is **invisible** — exit 0. That proves the config line is what does the work,
rather than the check having been going to catch it anyway.

**Defect 2: none — but it was worth checking, because wave 18 made this gate
blocking.** Making `Site unit tests` a required context put its reliability on
the critical path, so the risk that created had to be measured rather than
assumed. The suite has no randomness, no wall-clock reads, no network, and no
`performance.now`; run the way CI runs it, **626 tests pass in 230 ms**.

Along the way I ran `bun test src` and saw two failures, which were **my own
invocation error, not a repo defect**: the rune modules need
`--preload ./test-runes.js`, which CI passes and I had not. Recorded because the
first reading of a red suite is often the reader's mistake, and publishing it as
a finding would have been wrong.

**Defect 3: none, but the trap is now closed.** Both suites are scoped to
`src/lib`. Every one of the 52 test files is already under it, so nothing is
being lost today — but a test added anywhere else would be collected by nothing
and report nothing, which is this record's recurring defect in its purest form.
The `unit` job now refuses if a `*.test.*` file exists outside `src/lib` in
either tree. It belongs in that job precisely because that is the job which
would otherwise silently lose the test. Planting one is caught; removing it is
clean again.

## Wave 26 — seven digs, nothing found

No defect this wave. The record of where the ground was broken and found solid
is the deliverable, because the alternative is re-digging it later.

| dig | scale | result |
|---|---|---|
| install URL: canary vs what the website tells users | 2 URLs | agree |
| install endpoints live | `install.sh`, `install.ps1` | both 200, correct content-types |
| installer is POSIX, as its `#!/bin/sh` claims | 606 lines | `dash -n` clean — no bashisms |
| **served installer vs its source of truth** | 2 files | **byte-identical** |
| committed secrets | 4500 tracked files, 6 patterns | none |
| security reporting actually reachable | `security@avarok.net` | valid Protonmail MX; private reporting, secret scanning and push protection all enabled |
| orphaned assets over 500 KB | whole tree | none; the 14 MB demo GIF and 6 MB MP4 are both referenced by the README |

**One scare, resolved by looking.** Neither `install.sh` nor `install.ps1` is in
this repository, which for a script every user pipes into `sh` looked like an
unversioned, unreviewed artefact. It is not: both live in
`Avarok-Cybersecurity/atlas-recipes` under `scripts/`, with a 24 KB test suite
beside them, and the served copies are byte-identical to source. Worth recording
because "the installer is not in this repo" is true, alarming, and wrong as a
conclusion.

**One real gap, deliberately not closed.** 415 of 600 first-party `unsafe` sites
(69%, excluding vendored `cudarc`) carry no SAFETY note within six lines. The
Rust API guidelines want one on each. Retrofitting 415 comments across a CUDA
FFI codebase is a large mechanical diff that would not make a single one of them
more correct — it is the busywork this record exists to displace, and doing it
would bury the waves that found something. Written down as a known gap for
whoever decides it is worth a dedicated pass, with the honest note that the
value is in reviewing the unsafe, not in annotating it.

**Not defects, checked:** the three tracked `.log` files under
`docs/campaigns/**/raw/` are deliberate benchmark evidence, not stray artefacts.

---

## Wave 27 — three of the five commands existed only in a workflow file

**Two digs clean, recorded so they are not repeated:**

| dig | scale | result |
|---|---|---|
| every action SHA-pinned | 101 `uses:` across 24 workflows | 0 unpinned |
| composite actions' **internal** `uses:` pinned | 5 composites fetched and parsed | 0 unpinned |
| mdBook pages on disk vs linked from `SUMMARY.md` | 38 pages | 38 linked, 0 orphaned, 0 missing |

The composite check is the one worth keeping: `sha_pinning_required` is a
ruleset on *this* repo's workflow files and says nothing about what a composite
action does internally. This repo has already been bitten there — the SPDX job
carries a comment explaining that `apache/skywalking-eyes/header` was dropped
because it internally used an unpinned `actions/setup-go@v5`. All five current
composites are clean.

**Then the dig that landed, in the place I was most likely to have caused
damage.** Nine commits of this record changed who may stamp, added `/expedite`,
and changed what `/seal` does. So: does the documentation still describe the
code?

| command | accepted by the bot | in the README |
|---|---|---|
| `/help` | yes | **no** |
| `/stamp` | yes | yes, but **wrong** — said "anyone with write access", omitting the PR author |
| `/seal` | yes | yes |
| `/review` | yes | **no** |
| `/expedite` | yes | **no** |

**`/expedite` is the one that matters.** It skips certification and lets a PR
merge on the pipeline's own checks — an administrative override discoverable
only by reading a workflow file. Every one of these gaps was introduced by this
record's own waves, one commit at a time, and no single change looked like it
was leaving something out. That is how documentation drift actually happens: not
by neglect, but by a sequence of individually reasonable edits.

Fixed: the `/stamp` line now states the author rule and why it exists, and all
five commands are documented in a table with who may use each and what survives
a new commit.

**The guard reads the handler's own `case` arm rather than restating the verb
list.** A second hand-maintained list would drift from the first exactly the way
the README drifted from the handler. Run against the README as it stood, it
names `/help`, `/review` and `/expedite` and refuses.

**Three controls, and the third is the one that earns its place.** A complete
README passes; a missing verb is caught; and if the `case` arm is renamed or
restructured so the guard cannot find its input, it **refuses** rather than
finding nothing and reporting success. A guard that silently passes when it
cannot locate what it checks is the precise failure this suite exists to catch,
and it would be an embarrassing one to ship in the guard that checks for it.

---

## Wave 28 — five digs, nothing found, and a pattern in my own tooling

No defect this wave.

| dig | scale | result |
|---|---|---|
| every CODEOWNERS principal exists | 4 users | all exist; 3 write, 1 admin |
| ...and holds write access | 4 users | yes — a codeowner without write could never seal |
| commented CODEOWNERS rules are ignored | both parsers | `seal-coverage.py` refuses, `codeowners.rs` splits on `#` |
| issue forms are valid | 3 templates | 0 problems; blank issues disabled |
| the security contact link resolves | 1 link | HTTP 200 |

**The CODEOWNERS comment test is the one that was worth running.** A first sweep
reported `@someone-else` as a code owner — a placeholder-shaped name that turns
out to be a **real GitHub user** with read access. It is inside a comment, as an
illustrative example, so GitHub ignores it. But the question it raised was real:
if my sweep was fooled by a comment, is the code that decides seal coverage? A
commented-out rule honoured as live would grant a seal nobody granted. Both
parsers were checked directly against a fixture whose only grant is commented
out; both refuse. No defect, and now demonstrated rather than assumed.

**A pattern across this record worth naming.** Three separate throwaway checkers
written during these waves have been wrong, and each time the error was found by
questioning a suspicious finding rather than by reading the code:

| wave | my checker's bug | how it surfaced |
|---|---|---|
| 24 | `lstrip("./")` stripped the dot from `.github` | 14 "missing" scripts that obviously existed |
| 24 | resolved `/images/...` against the filesystem, not the site root | blog images "missing" from a working blog |
| 28 | treated a commented CODEOWNERS line as a rule | a placeholder-looking owner nobody had added |

Across waves 24 and 28 the first-pass sweeps produced 19 and 1 findings of which
2 and 0 were real. **The finding rate of an unverified sweep is not its defect
rate**, and the gap is large enough that acting on a raw sweep would have meant
mostly fixing things that were not broken. Every guard that survived into CI did
so only after being run against the defect it claims to catch.

---

## Wave 29 — the fix from wave 20 found the next defect, in production, within the hour

**First, a dig that came back clean, and stronger than clean.** The 599
committed benchmark records were checked against the gate's own cutover rule
(`SIGNATURE_REQUIRED_AFTER = 1_788_268_400`): 11 records fall after it and **all
11 carry a sidecar**; 588 fall before it and none does; no record has an
unusable timestamp; one signer fingerprint is registered.

Then the part worth having done: all 11 signatures were verified **with an
independent implementation** — Python's `cryptography`, reconstructing the
signed message from `signing.rs` (`record_bytes || git_sha`) rather than
trusting the Rust that produced them. **11 verify, 0 do not.** Cross-
implementation agreement is a materially stronger statement than the gate
re-checking its own arithmetic, and it is the kind of check worth doing once
rather than gating on.

**Then the wave's real finding, and its provenance is the point.** Wave 20 fixed
`/stamp` discarding the API's error. #856 was the first PR stamped with that fix
live. The warning it produced said:

```
403 "This workflow is already running"
```

**Not** the missing `actions: write` that wave 20 had inferred. The CI run was
`queued` — stamping while CI is in flight *always* 403s, and that is not a
failure at all: a run still in flight reads the mark when its gate jobs execute,
so there is nothing to re-run. The handler was raising a red job and a scary
warning for the ordinary case of stamping a PR shortly after opening it.

Two things follow, and both are worth stating plainly:

1. **Wave 20's stated cause was at best incomplete.** The reasoning there —
   "my PAT can re-run this, the App cannot, therefore `actions: write`" — was
   inference from a discarded error. On the run in question (already *completed*)
   it may well be right. As a general diagnosis of "the re-run failed" it was
   not, and the record should not read as though it were.
2. **The fix paid for itself immediately.** The only reason this is known is
   that wave 20 made the handler print what the API actually said. A guard that
   surfaces evidence keeps finding things after the wave that built it has
   ended; one that only reports a verdict does not.

Fixed: the handler now reads the run's `status` alongside its id, and a run that
is not `completed` produces a calm `::notice` explaining that its gate jobs will
read the mark, instead of a re-run attempt that cannot succeed. Three controls,
all three red when the check is reverted: stamping mid-run must not fail the
job, must not attempt a re-run, and must not post the warning.

---

## Wave 30 — out of CI and into the product: an OOB write guarded only by `debug_assert!`

> The code for waves 30 and 31 landed separately in #866: both fixes touch
> `crates/`, which re-opens all 11 gates, and holding this record behind a GPU
> campaign would have been the tail wagging the dog. These entries are the
> record; #866 is the diff.

**The defect (#799), and it is the most serious thing in this record.** A single
video request wrote **4.7× past** the ViT output allocation, raised
`CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` and poisoned the CUDA context. The process survived
and answered `503` to every subsequent request, **for every tenant**, until
someone restarted it.

The bound existed. It was a `debug_assert!` — compiled out of the `--release`
binaries we serve. So in production there was no bound at all, only a comment
saying there was one:

> The scheduler caps Σp ≤ p_max so this is normally unreachable — a correctness
> guard only.

Video defeats that cap. All temporal groups of one clip arrive as a **single**
media item and encode as one batch, so the per-item cap never sees the sum: 19
groups of 30×34 patches merge to 4845 rows against a 1024-row buffer.

**Fixed** by promoting the bound to a pure free function returning `Result`,
mirroring `check_pixel_len` in the sibling file — whose own doc comment already
observed that `forward_oversized_fallback` "bounds Σ*merged* p and not per-image
`p`", and closes with the line this wave earned: *prose is not a bound; this
is.* Two further hazards closed on the way: the old expression reached
`mp_i.last().unwrap()` whenever `mp_off` was non-empty, so a length mismatch was
a panic rather than an error; and the sum now uses `checked_add`, so an
overflowing offset cannot wrap into a passing comparison.

**The control is the bug's own shape, and it only means anything in release.**
Four tests, run under `--release`. Restoring `debug_assert!` makes two of them
**fail in release and pass in debug** — which is precisely the blindness that
caused the outage, and precisely what a debug-only test can never catch. The
issue asked for exactly this and named why.

**Scope, stated plainly.** This is the issue's fix (1): the outage. Fix (2) —
chunking the encode so long videos *work* rather than being refused — is not
done here. Video is now a clean per-request error instead of a multi-tenant
outage, which is strictly better and still not "video works".

**A second, separate defect found while verifying the first.**
`video_decode_ffmpeg::tests::a_hanging_decoder_is_killed_at_timeout` fails
intermittently in the full `--release` suite: three consecutive failures under
post-build load, then three consecutive passes on an idle machine, **with and
without this wave's change** (639+1 failing before it, 643+1 after — the four
extra are this wave's). It is therefore pre-existing and not caused here.

The panic is on the *message* assertion (`err.contains("decoding exceeded 1s")`),
not the elapsed-time one, so under load the decode fails for some other reason
before the timeout fires. **I did not capture the actual message**, so the cause
is unexplained rather than diagnosed, and it is filed as such. `cargo test
--workspace` is a required context, which makes this a latent source of red
builds that has nothing to do with the change under review.

---

## Wave 31 — a second bound asserted in prose, and a flake I could not reproduce

**Defect (#842): a json_schema request killed the scheduler thread three times
in one day.** The API kept accepting requests and logging sessions, generated
nothing ever again, and `/v1/models` still answered — so the server looked
healthy while being dead. Only a restart recovered it.

```
cannot roll back 96 tokens: only 1 steps recorded
```

**The diagnosis came from the codebase disagreeing with itself.** Four
production callers rewind the grammar matcher. Three of them —
`spec_step.rs:462→470` and `verify_pipeline_helper.rs:343→391` and `503→548` —
capture `num_history_steps()` before the span and pass the *delta*. One, the
watchdog path, passed a raw count of **sequence** tokens. The crate already
documents why that is wrong, on `num_history_steps` itself, calling it BUG#3:
`accept_token` returns `true` for stop/EOS and in the **terminated** state
without advancing the matcher. A `json_schema` matcher terminates the moment its
object closes, so every token after that records nothing — 96 dropped against 1
recorded step.

The comment above the call stated the precondition that had stopped holding:

> every dropped token ... was therefore fed to `grammar_state.accept_token`, so
> `rollback(dropped)` is exact.

That is wave 30's defect again, one crate over: **a bound asserted in prose**.
Two waves, two outages, both from a comment standing where a check belonged.

**`min(dropped, steps)` was considered and rejected**, and the reasoning is
pinned in a test so a later "helpful" clamp has to argue with it: with a
terminated matcher the recorded steps belong to tokens that are being **kept**,
so a partial rewind corrupts state that the panic at least left visible.
Refusing is the honest answer and is the correct one in the reported case —
those 96 tokens advanced the matcher zero times.

**The control is the tempting wrong fix.** Changing refuse to clamp turns three
of the four tests red — and leaves `an_accountable_span_still_rewinds_exactly`
green, because clamping and refusing genuinely agree when `dropped ≤ steps`.
A control that reddened all four would have been measuring less, not more.

**Two process failures of my own this wave, both recorded because they nearly
cost something.**

1. `cargo test -p spark-server --lib scheduler::rollback` printed
   **`ok. 0 passed; 104 filtered out`**. `mod scheduler` belongs to the *binary*
   target, not the lib, so `--lib` could never contain those tests — and cargo
   reports that as success. That is the "a passing test may not have run" trap,
   and it was caught only by noticing the count was zero.
2. The sabotage run was killed mid-build (exit 137, OOM under parallel `rustc`)
   **after** writing the sabotage and **before** restoring it. The clamp sat in
   the working tree until the next command checked. Re-run under a `trap ...
   EXIT INT TERM` and `-j 6`, which is how a destructive edit should have been
   written the first time.

**#858 — the flake — could not be reproduced.** 24 concurrent copies of the test
binary: 0 failures. Full suite under 40 CPU-burn processes on 20 cores, ×4: 0
failures. Full suite immediately after a forced rebuild and relink, ×2: 0
failures. Env-var races are ruled out (`FfmpegPolicy` reads no env; the crate
has no `set_var` in tests, deliberately) and temp-path collision is ruled out
(keyed on pid+seq). The remaining untested hypothesis is memory/IO pressure from
a **cold** full release build, which is what the three original failures ran
under. The message was never captured, so the cause stays unexplained and the
issue says so.

I also had to correct myself publicly on that issue: a first "reproduced 3/3
under load" was `grep -q a_hanging_decoder`, which matches the **passing**
`test ... ok` line. Fourth checker bug of this record, same shape as the other
three.

## Wave 32 — a benchmark that disagrees with itself, and three levers that proved nothing until one did

**#936: the same BFCL draw, at one commit, scored 12 of 995 samples
differently depending on whether it ran whole or in four shards.** Both paths
are deterministic, so something was carrying state between requests. Six arms
later the channel is named.

**The result, all legs single-variable** — each arm ran BOTH the whole draw and
its own four shards under the SAME setting, so the only thing differing inside
an arm is sharding:

| arm | setting | whole vs its own 4 shards |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | shipped | **12 disagree** |
| tail split off (`ATLAS_NO_TAIL_SPLIT=1`) | snapshot *producer* | 4 |
| Marconi restore off (`ATLAS_MARCONI_MIN_TOKENS=1e8`) | snapshot *consumer* | **2** |

The cause is cross-request **SSM snapshot reuse**. A snapshot saved by one
request enters a shared, globally evicted pool (128 slots / 19392 MB on GB10);
a later request restores from whichever eligible anchor is still there;
restoring at a different depth gives numerically different SSM state; at a
near-tied argmax the token flips. Sharding changes eviction pressure because it
changes run length. Closing the consumer is the more complete fix because
disabling the split removes only *one* producer — the checkpoint interval still
writes others, which is why 4 remain rather than 2.

**Corroboration that this is one mechanism and not two.** Across three
independent shards the two levers move overwhelmingly the same samples: 61
moved by the split lever, 15 by the restore lever, **11 shared** against an
independence prediction of 1.2 — a 9× enrichment, with 73% of the restore set
contained in the split set. Containment in that direction is what
producer/consumer predicts.

**Determinism, established rather than assumed.** Two runs of the same shard at
the same commit hours apart were **byte-identical** (md5 `4b3b58f0…`), and a
second arm was byte-identical to baseline. Every disagreement here is therefore
an ordering effect, not run-to-run noise.

**Ruled out, with evidence rather than argument.** The prefill pass shape:
`total = tokens.len()`, `cut` derives from `(total, block_size)`, and
`chunk_start` walks a fixed stride from 0, so the split *condition* is
deterministic on `(tokens, config)`. Sub-block prefix matching: with
`ATLAS_PREFIX_SUBBLOCK=0` — lever verified armed in `/proc/PID/environ` — the
output was byte-identical to baseline, 0 of 251 samples moved.

**Neither lever is a fix.** `NO_TAIL_SPLIT` changes 8.2% of all answers (61 of
748); restore-off changes 2% and discards the warm-turn saving Marconi exists
for. The floors were cut with both features on. The shippable form is
`ssm_cache_slots = "0"` as a serve override on KAT gates — a first-class flag,
recorded in the gate record — with the floors re-cut; that is queued as its own
arm rather than assumed.

**Four process failures of my own this wave, all of which produced a wrong
statement before they were caught.**

1. **An A/B on a lever that was never armed.** `mtp_carry_drafter_enabled` is
   `levers.drafter.carry && !mtp_multi_seq_mode()`, and `ATLAS_MTP_MAX_SEQS`
   defaults to **32**, so the cross-turn carry is force-disabled on any serve
   that does not set it to 1 — while the startup line printed `carry=ON
   (default)`, because it reported the two env vars and never consulted the
   cap. I ran a GPU arm turning that carry off and reported the null as
   evidence. The output was **byte-identical** to baseline: nothing changed,
   because nothing was on. A null arm that changes literally nothing is the
   signature of an inert lever, not of a lever without effect. Fixed in #968;
   both readers now share one predicate.
2. **An arm that moved two variables.** The first Marconi arm ran the lever on
   the *shards* and compared against the original lever-*on* whole run. Its
   "negative" result could not be read at all, and I reported it as a finding
   before withdrawing it. Every later arm runs both legs under the lever.
3. **A negative control that could not fail.** The control for the `shard`
   parameter's inherit-default changed `INHERIT_SHARD` itself — but `configure`
   compares against that same constant, so the two moved together and the test
   stayed green whatever it was set to. The real control changes only the
   ParamSpec default. Written into the test's own doc, because the inert
   version is the one a reader reaches for first.
4. **Four hours of commits on a detached HEAD.** An arm script's
   `git checkout --detach <pin>` left the worktree detached; nothing warns, and
   `git log origin/main..HEAD` looks normal. The work survived only because
   every push used `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>`. Checking the branch out then
   silently rewound six commits. Recovery was safe only because
   `merge-base --is-ancestor` and an empty `log <remote>..<local>` confirmed a
   fast-forward first.

**Two defects found in passing, both fixed.** The cross-turn drafter carry had
no request identity — admission was a *two-token* common prefix, and every
templated request shares hundreds — and the shared hidden-row interval had no
owner, so the warm path could pair one request's tokens with another's hidden
states. Both are #968, with every new test observed red against the
reintroduced defect. Neither is #936's mechanism: the carry was never armed.

**Doc comments that asserted safety the code did not have**, all corrected:
`mtp_store_range` claimed to be "per-sequence by construction … which is why
the carry path cannot inherit another sequence's hiddens"; three comments
justified a single carry slot with "MTP is concurrency-1", false since the
ladder raised the cap to 32; and `prefill_b.rs` carried two blocks disagreeing
about whether the tail split is conditional. A false safety comment is worse
than none — the concurrency-1 claim is what made the missing ownership check
look deliberate.

## Wave 33 — the fix from wave 32 regressed a gate, and the cell that did not move is what found it

Wave 32's ownership stamp shipped with a **24% decode regression at C=2**,
caught by its own certification campaign within the hour.

The stamp drew its per-sequence ticket from `mtp_prefill_capture_gen` — the
counter `owns_capture` compares against. Every `alloc_sequence` advanced it, and
`owns_capture` requires a sequence's captured generation to still EQUAL the
model's current one, so **any sequence admitted between another's capture and
its first propose silently turned that sequence's drafter prefill off**. Fewer
drafter rows, lower acceptance, slower decode.

| C | parent `main` | with the bug | again | after the fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 18.5 | 18.5 | 18.5 | 18.4 |
| **2** | **30.8** | **23.7** | **23.4** | **27.8** |
| 4 | 45.4 | 51.1 | — | 51.8 |
| 8–128 | 63.0 / 90.1 / 105.3 / 116.0 / 115.9 | within ~1% | — | 65.5 … |

`concurrency-sweep` failed its 24.1 floor twice, on two boxes, against a
same-morning control on the parent commit. C=2 TPOT went 62 → 79 → 66 ms.

**★ I read the diagnostic backwards, and said so publicly before the evidence
corrected me.** Seven cells matched and C=1 was *identical*, and I argued that
an unchanged C=1 proved there was no regression — a real decode regression would
surely show on the pure single-sequence path. It is the opposite: nothing is
admitted between a lone sequence's capture and its propose, so the shared
counter cannot move under it. C=1 could not have changed. **An invariant cell
narrows where a defect lives; it is not an alibi.** Cells that differ by
concurrency differ in scheduler discretion, so a C≥2-only regression points at
cross-sequence state rather than per-token math — which is exactly what this
was.

**The advice was there and I followed its letter.** The audit that proposed the
stamp warned that overloading `mtp_prefill_capture_gen` regresses the cold path,
and recommended a separate FIELD. I added the separate field and then drew it
from the shared counter, reinstating the hazard the advice existed to prevent.
**If two things need generations, they need two dispensers.**

**What actually caught it** was the control run on the parent commit, same box,
same hour. Without it the failure reads as box noise — this gate is
`Sensitivity::Speed` and its C=2 cell is known to sit close to its floor — and I
would have shipped a real regression while arguing it was variance. The
re-run that I queued *to confirm the variance hypothesis* is what refuted it.

Guarded by a source-level test asserting the ticket draw never names the capture
counter, observed red against the reintroduced defect. Source-level because the
coupling lives at a call site in `alloc_sequence_dispatch` that needs a whole
model to exercise, and a defect costing 24% of C=2 decode deserves a check that
runs in milliseconds rather than one that needs a GPU.

Cost on the record: the fix touches `crates/`, so the **ten gates that had
already passed at the previous pin are void** and the campaign is running again
from scratch. Sequencing the sweep first in the re-run was deliberate — had it
still failed, the two BFCL legs behind it were 3.5 h of waste.

Still open, and recorded as open rather than declared: 27.8 clears the 24.1
floor but sits below the parent's 30.8. One fixed run against one parent run
cannot separate residual regression from ordinary C=2 spread.

## Wave 34 — the wave-33 entry above is wrong, and the metric is why

**Withdrawn: the "24% decode regression at C=2" in wave 33.** There was no
24% regression. The number came from comparing three parent samples that all
happened to draw the fast mode against two candidate samples that both drew
the slow one.

**What the evidence actually shows.** `c2_aggregate_tok_s` on this recipe is
**trimodal**, not noisy around a mean: TPOT clusters at 62–63 / 66–67 / 79 ms
— about 30.6 / 27.5 / 23.5 tok/s — with nothing in between. Verified from the
run store: clean `main` on 2026-09-07 scored **30.21 → 23.70 → 30.54 → 23.56**
in four consecutive runs at one commit. And on 2026-09-08 an interleaved A/B
on one box saw the *baseline arm alone* draw **28.7 then 25.2** at C=2 at the
identical commit — a 12% swing against itself — while every other concurrency
rung stayed inside ±2.9%.

So two C=2 numbers differing by 20% are two draws from different modes, not a
before-and-after. Any claim built on a handful of draws from that cell is
unsupported, in either direction.

**What survives.** The dispenser fix itself stands, on MECHANISM: the store
ticket sharing the capture counter is a defect whether or not it costs
measurable throughput, and the source-level test that goes red against the
reintroduced coupling proves the fix is wired to the thing it fixes. Wave
33's other claim — that an invariant cell narrows where a defect lives rather
than exonerating it — also stands; it is what located the bug. Only the
magnitude is withdrawn.

**The lesson, stated so the next wave does not repeat it.** Before attributing
a difference in a benchmark cell to a diff, establish the cell's
DISTRIBUTION. A cell that is multi-modal cannot be read from n≈2 per arm, and
the tell is cheap to look for: run the *same* commit several times and see
whether it disagrees with itself. Wave 33 did not do that, and the invariant
C=1 cell — correctly used to locate the defect — was also, wrongly, taken as
evidence that the C=2 movement was real.

**The commit subjects on this branch still carry the withdrawn number.**
Correcting them means rewriting `d8440fb7e`, which is the commit PR #968's
eleven gate records are measured at; that would void the certification and
cost a full re-run. Recorded here rather than silently paid.

## Wave 35 — a green control, a dead-code fix site, and a required check caught before it ran

Branch `feat/kat-equality`: #936 + #835 + #971 composed. This entry records the
guards, not the feature work, and what each control actually proved.

### The control that came back GREEN was worth more than the four that went red

`two_failed_requests_do_not_agree_with_each_other` claimed to pin that a failed
request never reads as agreement. It set **both** orders to `Error`, so
`verdict_for` returned through the *reference-order* branch and never reached
the later-order branch the test named. Neutering that branch — making a failed
later order `continue`, i.e. be skipped as agreement — left the test **passing**.

The test was decorative and nothing but the control could have told me. It is
now two tests that each reach their own branch, each with its own control, and
both go red when their branch is neutered.

**The lesson:** a test whose setup satisfies an *earlier* early-return never
executes the code it is named after. When a control comes back green, the
default hypothesis is that the test does not reach the mutation — not that the
mutation was harmless.

### The fix site named in the plan was dead code

The approved plan named `radix_tree/snapshot.rs:238` as the site of the SSM
snapshot cross-request channel. That line is inside `lookup`, which is
`#[allow(dead_code)]`. **The serving path is `snapshot_tier::lookup_tiered`**,
which carried its own copy of the same condition. Editing the cited line would
have compiled, read correctly in review, and changed nothing that runs.

Both now call one predicate. A source scan fails if the raw condition is
spelled again anywhere under `radix_tree/`, matching the **shape** of the gate
(both field reads in one condition) rather than an identifier, because a
re-spelling would not reuse the name.

**And the exclusion list is the load-bearing half.** The scan excused
`snapshot.rs` while the predicate lived there. When the predicate moved to its
own module, leaving that excusal behind would have left a blind spot in exactly
the file that had held one of the two copies. Control: re-spelling the raw
condition in `snapshot.rs` now FAILS the guard, naming `snapshot.rs:242`.
Before the exclusion moved, that same mutation passed.

### A required check caught without pushing

The predicate and its reasoning took `snapshot.rs` from 451 to 532 lines
against a 500-line cap it is not allow-listed for. `file-size-cap` is required,
so the branch would have gone red. Found by extracting that workflow's own
allow-list and running the rule locally over all 1993 files — not by pushing
and waiting. Allow-listing was the smaller diff and the wrong one; the
predicate is the shared thing and now says so with its own module.

### A false RED, which is the same family as a false green

A verification chain read `... | grep -c pattern && cargo test ...`. `grep -c`
exits **1** when the count is zero, so on a CLEAN clippy the `&&`
short-circuited, the suite never ran, and the wrapper reported `test_exit=1`. A
clean tree was reported to me as a failure. Terminate any counting grep in a
chain with `|| true` and test the captured number, never the exit status.

Separately, a control-runner that flagged `error: test failed, to rerun pass…`
as "BUILD BROKE — control INVALID" was wrong: that is cargo's normal exit line
for a *failing test*. A build break prints **no** `test` lines at all, which is
the signal to key on.

### Aggregate scores are not the instrument

An earlier reading excluded channel M1 for #936 on matching *aggregate* serial
rates. The mechanism predicts an invariant population rate with varying
membership, so the aggregate could not distinguish the hypotheses. The
per-sample diff is the instrument; the aggregate is not.

The harness then nearly repeated the mistake in a different way: it reported
`NO responses.jsonl FOUND` for a completed leg. `bfcl/exec.rs:71` writes **one
fixed path** and overwrites it every leg, so the whole leg's 995 rows were
intact and about to be destroyed by the next shard. Both boxes now snapshot the
file on every change. Two attempts to launch that watcher reported "already
running" because `pgrep -f` matched the launching SSH command line itself —
the same self-match family as `pkill -f` killing its own shell.

### What is NOT claimed

The equality gate registers as a **promotion candidate**, not a required gate.
Its bar is that the shipped regime is order-independent, and that is unmeasured
on this tree. A gate may not certify itself in the change that first records
it — the same rule that keeps a speed floor from being cut from the run it
judges. Promotion, with the sample count actually measured, is a follow-up.

Measured en route and worth recording: the whole BFCL leg scores 84.22 / 84.12
on current `main` and 83.92 / 84.22 under `mtp_gate=force` +
`enable_prefix_caching=false`. Both clear the committed bars, so the regime is
**not** score-neutral — which is why the floors are re-cut in a second PR and
why the History pane now draws a labelled band at the boundary instead of one
continuous line.

### Open finding, not fixed here: the MTP gate's dwell counter can switch on one probe

`SWITCH_DWELL_WINDOWS = 2` is meant to require two consecutive losing windows
before the scheduler changes arms. It does not.

`arbitrate()` refuses to run when the OTHER mode's EWMA is `stale`, which looks
like a freshness requirement and is not one. `stale` is set in exactly two
places — a depth-regime change, and a discarded window — and cleared whenever a
measurement is recorded. It means "the economics moved", never "this number is
old". So a single serial probe stays non-stale indefinitely, `arbitrate()`
re-fires against that same unchanged measurement on the next window, and
`losing_windows` reaches 2 on the strength of ONE probe.

**Deliberately not fixed on `feat/kat-equality`.** The correct fix requires a
FRESH other-mode comparison per losing window, which changes WHEN the engine
switches arms — a throughput-affecting change. This branch already carries
#971's 68-file diff across the hot paths, and the plan names attribution as its
main risk: a speed-gate movement here would already need a bisect to explain.
Adding a second speed-affecting change makes that strictly worse, and the
equality work does not need it. It belongs in its own PR with its own measured
A/B.

What this branch DOES ship for #835 is the comparability pin — `c{c}_accept_len`
plus an INCONCLUSIVE verdict when a cell ran the serial arm — which is the part
that stops an arm change being reported as a regression. That is orthogonal to
when the switch happens.

### Step 0b, answered: the baseline did not move, and the score could not have told us

Whole BFCL draw vs its own four shards, one box, current `main`, shipped
config: 995 vs 995, **12 disagreeing samples** — the identical count measured
months earlier at a pin that is not an ancestor of `main`. #968's drafter-carry
session gate landed in between and changed the number by zero.

What makes this worth recording is the instrument. The whole leg scored
84.22 / 84.12 and the four shards recombine to close to the same totals, so a
SCORE comparison — the obvious thing to run — would have reported agreement.
Two different sets of answers can total identically, and here twelve of them
do. Only a per-sample join on `sample_id` sees it.

This is the same error, in a new costume, as the earlier wrong exclusion of the
MTP gate for #936: that reading compared aggregate serial-token RATES between
arms and found them equal, when the mechanism predicts an invariant population
rate with varying membership. Aggregates are not a weaker version of the
per-sample diff; for this class of bug they are not evidence at all.

Ten of the twelve are `live_irrelevance`, the subset predicted, and
`live_irrelevance_2-0-2` — previously recorded as surviving even with SSM
restore disabled — is among them.

### Equality reached: 0 of 995, against a baseline of 12

The acceptance criterion for #936 was EXACT equality — the whole BFCL draw and
its own four shards answering identically for every `sample_id`, not "within
noise". Measured on one box, one commit, temperature 0:

| arm | serve config | n | disagreeing |
|---|---|---|---|
| historical (pin `e897463b54`) | shipped | 995 | 12 |
| base (current `main`) | shipped | 995 | 12 |
| **C** | `mtp_gate=force` + `enable_prefix_caching=false` | 995 | **0** |

Under the base arm's rate a zero has probability about 6e-6, but the point is
not the p-value: the criterion was exactness, and exactness is what the diff
reports. 995 of 995 byte-identical.

**Both levers were proven armed, and proven to be the only difference.** The
base arm's log says `Prefix caching: ENABLED (radix tree)` and `mtp_gate=auto`;
arm C's says `Prefix caching: disabled` and `mtp_gate=force`; every other entry
in the `kernel flags:` line is identical between them. That check matters more
than it looks: `enable_prefix_caching` DEFAULTS to false, so the override could
have been a no-op — it is the gate's recipe that turns it on, and only the base
arm's log proves it was on to begin with.

**What this does NOT establish.** Arm C is not the shipped regime. `--hermetic`
closes those two channels AND gates every snapshot entry by session, so it is
strictly more closed. Inferring hermetic from arm C is the same shape of step
that produced the earlier wrong exclusion of the MTP gate, so arm D measures
`--hermetic` exactly as it ships rather than reasoning from arm C.

**Equality costs score, and that is why floors are a separate PR.** The whole
leg scores 84.22 / 84.12 unclosed and 83.92 / 84.22 closed. Both clear the
committed bars, so nothing is blocked — but the regime is not score-neutral,
which is exactly why the History pane now draws a labelled band at a regime
boundary instead of one continuous line, and why no floor is declared in the
change that first measures it.

### This branch may not seal itself: 7 of 15 BOUNDARY_FILES change

Sealing a certified campaign is delegated by default in this repository, with
an enumerated list of cases that still need a human. One applies: *the merge
lands a `BOUNDARY_FILE` change whose only evidence is this campaign.*

Touched here, four of them new files:

| file | |
|---|---|
| `gate/coverage.rs` | the BOUNDARY_FILES list itself, PROMOTION_CANDIDATES, NOT_REQUIRED, a new excludes set |
| `gate/bench.rs` | refuses an under-pinned hermetic baseline |
| `gate/check.rs` | modified |
| `gate/hermetic.rs` | **new** — the table of what `--hermetic` closes |
| `gate/group.rs`, `gate/check_group.rs`, `gate/check_paths.rs` | **new**, from the sharding work |

A boundary file decides whether any gate passes. Offering the campaign those
files govern as proof that the files are right is circular — the unit tests and
the 226-check certification self-test cover the LOGIC, but the campaign is the
only BEHAVIOURAL evidence, which is precisely the condition the rule names.

So the campaign runs to completion and the evidence gets posted, and the merge
waits for a human. Recorded here rather than decided at the end of a long
night, because that is when the temptation to call it "clean enough" is largest.

### `--hermetic` is byte-identical to its hand-configured equivalent, across boxes

Arm C closed the two channels by hand (`mtp_gate=force` +
`enable_prefix_caching=false`) and reached 0/995. Arm D ran the SHIPPED flag,
`--hermetic`, on a different box. The whole leg's per-sample output:

| run | box | config | sha256 (first 32) |
|---|---|---|---|
| arm D | `spark-43fa` | `--hermetic` | `a9aadaa1f0e337ec9afd4a6728f057b2` |
| arm C | `spark-28c2` | the two overrides by hand | `a9aadaa1f0e337ec9afd4a6728f057b2` |
| base | `spark-43fa` | shipped | `8490c4bdef100bc1c8fee30879184fda` |

One comparison, three claims:

1. **The flag expands to exactly what it claims.** Not approximately equivalent
   to the hand-configured pair — byte-identical over 995 samples.
2. **Neither lever is a no-op.** Base differs, which is the check that stops a
   green from meaning "the override did nothing".
3. **The engine is bit-reproducible under hermetic ACROSS MACHINES.** Two
   different GB10 boxes, 995 samples, identical bytes. Only within-box
   reproducibility had been established before; this is stronger, and it is
   what makes a cross-box shard comparison meaningful at all.

Wall time is unchanged (5786 s vs the base arm's 5838 s) even though hermetic
disables the prefix cache — consistent with BFCL being single-turn, where a
prefix cache has almost nothing to reuse.

### Watch item for this campaign: #835 is live on `concurrency-sweep`

Located precisely, because an earlier reading of mine inferred the ladder from
an old RECORD rather than the config and got it wrong:

| gate | ladder | `c2_aggregate_tok_s` floor |
|---|---|---|
| `concurrency-sweep` | `1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128` (a `param_overrides` pin, not the schema default) | **min 25.0, noise 0.95 → effective 24.05** |
| `concurrency-sweep-dflash2` | `1,2,4,8,16` | min 36.0, noise 0.62 |

The C=2 cell is TRIMODAL at roughly 30.6 / 27.5 / 23.5 tok/s with nothing
between, and the lowest mode sits BELOW the effective floor. So
`concurrency-sweep` can fail on this campaign for reasons that have nothing to
do with this branch's diff — that is the whole of #835.

**What the fix does and does not do.** With the accept-len pin, a C=2 cell that
ran the SERIAL arm (`accept_len < 1.5`, against ~2.3 on MTP) now reports
INCONCLUSIVE naming the arm change, instead of a floor breach claiming a
regression two samples cannot support. That is more honest and it is NOT a
pass: `verdict_passes()` is `verdict == "PASS"`, so an INCONCLUSIVE gate is
still undischarged and the leg needs re-running.

**Which is fine, and is the point.** A re-run whose cause is NAMED ("the C=2
cell ran the serial arm") is a different thing from a re-run that turned red to
green for no stated reason — the latter is on the enumerated list of cases a
human must see. If this gate goes INCONCLUSIVE, the cause is in the verdict
string and the re-run is defensible; if it goes FAIL on the floor with
`accept_len` ~2.3, that is a real speed finding and must be attributed, which
on this branch means bisecting against #971's 68-file hot-path diff.

### Equality proven on the SHIPPED regime: `--hermetic` is 0 of 995

Arm C proved equality was reachable with the two channels closed by hand. Arm D
ran the flag as it ships. Whole draw versus its own four shards
(251 + 249 + 248 + 247 = 995), one box, one commit, temperature 0:

| arm | serve config | n | disagreeing |
|---|---|---|---|
| historical (pin `e897463b54`) | shipped | 995 | 12 |
| base (current `main`) | shipped | 995 | **12** |
| C | `mtp_gate=force` + `enable_prefix_caching=false` | 995 | **0** |
| **D** | **`--hermetic`** | **995** | **0** |

The chain, so no link is taken on trust:

1. **Base is broken and unchanged.** 12/995 on current `main`, the same count
   measured at a pin that is not an ancestor of it — #968 moved it by zero.
2. **The closures fix it.** Arm C, 0/995.
3. **The shipped flag IS the closures.** Arm D's whole leg is byte-identical to
   arm C's across two different boxes (`a9aadaa1…`), while base differs.
4. **The shipped flag reaches equality itself.** Arm D, 0/995 — not inferred
   from arm C, measured.
5. **The levers were proven armed.** Base logs `Prefix caching: ENABLED (radix
   tree)` / `mtp_gate=auto`; arms C and D log `disabled` / `force`; every other
   entry in the `kernel flags:` line is identical.

The negative control the plan demanded — "the same comparison without hermetic
must go red on the known 12" — is satisfied by the base arm, which produced
exactly twelve, ten of them `live_irrelevance` (the predicted subset) and one
of them `live_irrelevance_2-0-2`, a sample the plan named specifically. The
count, the distribution and a named member all agree; the historical list of
ids was not available to compare set-for-set, and that limit is stated rather
than glossed.

### #835's pin fired on a real campaign, and stopped a false regression report

`concurrency-sweep` failed on this branch's certification campaign with:

> INCONCLUSIVE: 4 of 8 cells ran the SERIAL arm, not the speculative one
> (accept_len < 1.5) — the two arms differ by ~1.3x in delivered tok/s, so this
> is an arm change and not a regression. Re-run, or pin the arm, before reading
> any floor

That is the verdict this work added. **Without it the run would have been judged
against the floors and reported as a regression caused by this branch** — the
exact false claim #835 is about, made from a cell whose distribution cannot
support it.

The comparison that makes it unambiguous ran on the SAME BOX minutes later:
`concurrency-sweep-dflash2`, whose ladder pins C=2 with DFlash speculation
armed, measured **C2 = 46.6 against a 35.4 floor** and passed every rung. Same
hardware, same commit, same night — one gate's C=2 cell in the serial arm, the
other's in the speculative arm. That is #835 in a single pair of runs.

**And it is evidence for the defect this branch deliberately did NOT fix.** Four
of eight cells changing arms inside one sweep is a lot of switching, and the MTP
dwell counter is why: `SWITCH_DWELL_WINDOWS = 2` is meant to require two
consecutive losing windows, but `stale` means "the economics moved", never "this
number is old", so a single probe carries both. The hysteresis fix was deferred
because it changes WHEN arms switch and this branch already carries #971's
68-file hot-path diff; this run is the measured cost of that deferral, recorded
so the follow-up PR has evidence rather than an argument.

**What an INCONCLUSIVE verdict does and does not license.** It is not a pass:
`verdict_passes()` requires `PASS`, so the gate stays undischarged. It licenses
ONE re-run, because the first run measured nothing about the diff — 4 of 8 cells
ran a different arm. It does not license re-running until green: if the second
run is also INCONCLUSIVE, that is a finding about the INSTRUMENT (the arm needs
pinning in BENCH.toml, which is the follow-up PR's job) and must be reported as
one. The distinction matters because "a gate failed and a re-run made it green,
with no named cause" is on the enumerated list of things a human must see — and
the whole point of the verdict string is that the cause here IS named.

### A negative control proves the code does what you designed. It cannot prove the design is right.

The #835 arm pin had everything this document argues for. Unit tests that
reached the branch they named. A negative control that was RUN and observed red.
A verdict string that explained itself. It shipped, and it was wrong — and only
a real gate run could show it.

The design said: a cell that ran the serial arm is not comparable, so exclude it
and fail the run INCONCLUSIVE. Every test asserted exactly that, and every test
passed. What no test could know is that at wide batch **the MTP gate drops
speculation on purpose**, so C=8 upward legitimately run serial, and those rungs'
floors were CALIBRATED on runs that did. The pin dropped five of eight cells,
made `peak_aggregate_tok_s` read 49.5 (from C=4) instead of ~115 (from C=64),
and failed a gate carrying nine consecutive passing records.

The cell #835 is actually about — C=2 — ran the MTP arm and passed at 30.02
against a 25.0 floor. The pin fired everywhere except the place it was for.

**What separates this from the twelve failure modes already in
[[a-passing-test-may-not-have-run]]:** those are all ways a check fails to
measure what it claims. This one measured exactly what it claimed. The claim was
wrong. A control answers "is this check wired to the thing it checks"; it is
silent on "is the thing worth checking".

**The rule.** For any check that will REFUSE something — a gate, a validator, a
parse-time bail — ask what the refused state looks like when it is CORRECT.
Here: "a cell ran without speculation" is correct and expected at wide batch,
and the design never asked. The cheap version of that question is to look at
what the existing passing records contain: nine of them carried the very
condition the new rule refuses.

And the corollary already in practice here: run the guard against real history
before trusting it. The nine records were on disk the whole time.

### A cap that truncates is not a cap that samples

The equality gate takes a `sample_cap`. Reading it as "trade power for time"
— 257 of 995 buys ~95 % of the power for a quarter of the GPU — is wrong twice
over, and the second error is the dangerous one.

`sample_cap` calls `Vec::truncate` on the drawn samples, and `draw::plan`
concatenates subsets in **sorted name order**. So the cap does not sample the
draw; it selects a deterministic PREFIX of it, and therefore selects WHICH
SUBSETS are compared at all. A cap of 257 compares `irrelevance`,
`live_irrelevance`, `live_multiple`, `live_parallel` and
`live_parallel_multiple`, and never looks at `live_simple`, `multiple`,
`parallel`, `parallel_multiple` or any `simple_*` — 738 samples, permanently
invisible.
"95 % power" describes a random subsample. This is not one, and no amount of
repetition changes which samples it omits.

The second error: the gate hunts an ORDER effect, and truncating the draw
changes what ran before every surviving sample. The 12-in-995 divergence was
measured with all 995 running. Nothing about that measurement licenses the
claim that the same 12 appear when only 257 run. A cap validated by a control
at the FULL draw is a control for a different instrument.

So the cap was chosen from the divergence's own distribution rather than from
a power calculation. The 12 samples that diverge on this checkpoint are 10
`live_irrelevance`, 1 `live_multiple` and 1 `live_parallel_multiple`. In the
golden draw's concatenation order those sit at positions 25–112, 113–217 and
234–257. **257 is the end of `live_parallel_multiple`** — the smallest prefix
containing every subset in which the effect has ever been observed.

★ Do not describe the remaining 738 as "the non_live tail", which the first
draft of this entry did. It is live_simple (25) plus the non_live half (713),
and live_simple is a **`live`** subset — the same category the effect was
argued to live in. No live_simple divergence has been seen by either
instrument, so the cap is still defensible, but the honest form of the claim
names the one subset a reviewer would ask about instead of hiding it behind a
category label that happened to be convenient.

**The control, run at the cap.** The open arm at 257 samples in two orders
reads **36 divergences of 257** (spark-43fa, 2026-09-10, 3878 s; identical 221,
unmeasured 0, empty_replies 0). So the cap is red with a wide margin and the
gate is not measuring nothing.

Note 36 against #936's 12: those are different instruments, not a regression
between them. #936 compared the whole draw against its own four shards; this
gate reverses the request order against ONE server, which perturbs more, so it
sees more. The prose that reports a gate's sensitivity has to name which
instrument produced the number, or the two get read as a trend.

The cap also turned out to be the cheap half of the decision it looked like.
At 257 the gate costs ~65 min; the whole draw in two orders would be ~4.2 h, on
every PR, forever — against a campaign that is ~4.5 h in total today.

**The rule.** Before capping any draw, ask whether the cap samples or
truncates, and if it truncates, ask what it deterministically stops looking at.
Then re-run the negative control AT THE CAP: a control that went red on the
full draw says nothing about a capped one.
