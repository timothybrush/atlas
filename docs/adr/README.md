# Architecture Decision Records

This directory captures the major design decisions behind Atlas in the
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) lite format. Each record is a single
markdown file with **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**.
ADRs are append-only — when a decision is revisited, write a new ADR that
*supersedes* the old one rather than editing history.

## When to write an ADR

Write one when you make a decision that:

- Constrains the shape of code other people will write (file-size cap, module
  idiom, error-handling style).
- Locks in a runtime contract that's hard to undo (license choice, API surface,
  on-disk format, kernel target tuples).
- Has a real "we considered X and rejected it" alternative that future
  contributors will rediscover unless we write it down.

Don't write one for routine refactors, dependency bumps, or single-PR
implementation choices — those belong in commit messages or design docs.

## Format

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Short title

**Status:** Accepted | Superseded by ADR-MMMM | Deprecated
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What's the situation that forced a decision?

## Decision
What did we decide?

## Consequences
What's better, what's worse, what new problems did we create?
```
