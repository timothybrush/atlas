# Decode-fold campaign — beat vLLM on TPOT (the last axis)

## ►► MERGE STATUS / RECENCY (running doc — what needs folding, and how fresh)
| piece | decode relevance | in main @011bee65? | recency | action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #356 drafter defaults + K=4 dispatch + prefill smem | base (−24% TPOT via carry) | **YES** (64852303, 07-23) | fresh | BASE |
| #332 lm_head batched-GEMV M≤4 | decode GEMV | **YES** (w4a16_gemv_batchm) | fresh | banked — drop |
| #330 f00df894 w4a16 2-chunk ILP | decode GEMV | **YES** (content-identical) | fresh | banked — drop |
| GDN_FLA k-split (perf/gdn-fla-chunked) | **prefill only** (not decode) | no | 06-05 base | deprioritize |
| **L1 AVAROK_GDN_FUSED_VERIFY** (fuse K=2 verify epilogue) | **decode** | in-tree, **default OFF** | fresh | **A/B now → flip if win** |
| **L6 unlock-K=3** (216724ec M≤4 verify proj + fuse K=3 conv epilogue) | **decode (2 tok/step)** | partial (#356 8bc3f783) | 07-18, 06-14 base | **dev track (hard)** |
| FP8 MTP head (e0ab9087) | drafter step cost | no | 07-23, 06-14 base | low pri (accuracy risk) |

**Bottom line:** main already folded the GEMV/lm_head decode wins. Genuine un-banked TPOT
levers = **L1 (free flip, testing)** and **L6 (unlock K=3, real work)**. The never-run
measurement = full MLCommons e2e on consolidated main.

## ►► FLEET ALLOCATION (all boxes working)
- **dgx1** (spark, 10.10.10.1, THIS session): fold campaign — L1 A/B → fold → L6 dev; qwen heavylift consults; ledger.
- **dgx2** (spark-43fa, 10.10.10.2): **full MLCommons e2e on main @011bee65** (compounding baseline, same sampling, ARM=bare K=2). GPU-dedicated.
- **dgx3** (spark-28c2, 10.10.10.3): **profiling** — nsys decomposition of the K=2 decode/verify TPOT via microbench (feeds L6 viability); respect FP8-256K flagship if resident.


**Branch:** `perf/decode-fold-2026-07-24` off `origin/main @ 011bee65` (contains #356 = the
latest documented good-e2e version: drafter-context defaults + prefill smem fix + K=4 dispatch).

**Method (per repo rules):** iterate LOCALLY, fold each proven win into THIS branch respectively.
No PR-per-lever. Each lever must clear, in order, before it is folded:
1. **Coherence / Gate-C2 NVFP4 smoke** (tool-call + coherence) — catches NVFP4 garbage A/B/D miss.
2. **Measured decode A/B** — fixed trajectory, temp 0, identical emitted tokens confirmed
   (spec decode is trajectory-dependent), N≥3, no N=1 stochastic claim.
3. **Fold** only if TPOT win holds AND accuracy (BFCL subset / IoU) does not regress.
E2e (full 1007 MLCommons, temp0/seed42, no dflash) is a COMPOUNDING CHECKPOINT after wins land,
not per-lever.

## Baseline to beat (vLLM ref, MLPerf-edge agentic, dense-27B)
wall 7438.35s · IoU 0.6194 · BFCL 79.90 · TTFT p50 2985ms · **TPOT p50 31.39ms**

## Current best Avarok (documented, = base #356)
wall ~4984–5023s · IoU 0.6254–0.6285 · BFCL 87.0–87.6 · TTFT p50 ~1557–1582ms · **TPOT p50 39.95ms**
→ Wins wall/TTFT/BFCL/IoU. **Sole gap: TPOT 39.95 vs 31.39 (1.27×).**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | base #356 | main 011bee65 | building | anchor 39.95ms | BUILDING |

Refeed: the prefill/decode-refeed already ships in base (#356). Accepted-row refeed
(`AVAROK_MTP_REFEED_ACCEPTED`) stays OFF (refuted on GB10, Gate A 9/10 fail). NOT in scope.
DFlash: OUT — changes verify/sampling, not a same-sampling MLCommons lever.

## Fold-scope archaeology (2026-07-24) — main already absorbed most decode wins
Checked each candidate's content against `origin/main @ 011bee65`:
- **#332 lm_head batched-GEMV** → ALREADY IN MAIN (`impl_a3.rs:158-171` dispatches M∈{3,4} via `w4a16_gemv_batchm`). DROP.
- **#330 `f00df894` w4a16 2-chunk ILP decode GEMV** → content IDENTICAL to main (0-line diff on `w4a16_gemv.cu`/`_fused.cu`). ALREADY BANKED. DROP.
- **GDN_FLA (`perf/gdn-fla-chunked`)** → PREFILL path (helps TTFT/wall, already won), NOT verify/decode. DEPRIORITIZE for TPOT.
- **FP8 MTP head (`e0ab9087`)** → NOT in main, but its files are the ones #356 rewrote (`mtp_head.rs` +292); needs manual port, and quantizing the MTP head is an ACCURACY risk (bf16 head was deliberate, ~3.1%). LOW priority.
- **K=3/K=4 verify batched projections (`216724ec`)** → NOT in main (net diff on `dense_ffn.rs`+77 `impl_a1.rs`+51 `types.rs`); partially overlaps #356's `8bc3f783`. This is the "unlock K=3" lever. REAL, but hard + accuracy-sensitive.

**Conclusion:** the "fragmented un-merged wins" are mostly already in main. Genuine un-banked TPOT levers reduce to TWO:
  1. **L1 `AVAROK_GDN_FUSED_VERIFY`** (fused K=2 conv/norm verify epilogue) — in main, default OFF. ← testing.
  2. **L6 unlock-K=3** (cheap K=3/K=4 verify: 216724ec projections + fuse K=3 conv epilogue) — net-new reconciliation, highest TPOT upside (2 accepted tok/step) but hardest.
Therefore: base consolidation branch ≈ main; the decisive measurement is a **full e2e on consolidated (main + L1 if it wins)** vs vLLM — the compounding check that was never run.

## Log
- L0 base: built OK, target=(gb10,qwen3.6-27b,nvfp4) 157 kernels, md5 bfb9d6e0. Serve img avarok-gb10:followups.
- **dgx3 PROFILE (2026-07-24, GPU idle, clean):** K=2 GDN verify/layer = 60% WY recurrence (wy2 15.2µs) + 22% per-token rms_norm + 18% per-token conv1d (epilogue 40% is launch-bound). **WY recurrence K-scaling is SUBLINEAR:** wy2 17.0µs / wy3 22.5µs (1.32×) / wy4 25.9µs (1.52×); per-token cost DROPS with K. → **verify COST is not the wall; tokens-accepted-per-step (p2 accept) is.** "Verify depth wall" = strix full-serialized path, NOT the GB10 recurrence. Caveat: microbench excludes lm_head/attn/FFN/rollback — confirm at full serve. lm_head M≤4 batchm already in main ✓. Artifacts dgx3:/workspace/decode_profile_20260724_020525/.
- **qwen FRAME CONSULT (2026-07-24):** decisive scalar **G = (E3/E2)/(S3/S2)**. K=3 improves TPOT iff G>1; beats vLLM iff **G>1.273**. p2≈0.53 ⇒ only ~48% of steps reach draft3 (P12≈p1·p2≈0.477) ⇒ ΔE_max≈0.477 tok/step. With bonus-token accounting E2≈2.377: even perfect p3=1.0 → a=1.20 → at r=1.0 (fused K3 == K2 cost) G=1.20 → **improves but MISSES 31.39ms unless fused K3 is CHEAPER than K2**. Unfused K3 (56–59ms observed) → r≈1.4 → G≈0.86 → regresses (matches observation). **Verdict: K=3 unlikely a standalone TPOT closer given the p2 cliff.** Kill-gate: S3/S2>1.10 → kill L6; only viable if S3/S2≤1.05 AND p3≥0.6.
  - **qwen's Measurement C (I MISSED THIS):** run non-spec / --num-drafts 1 leg. If T_no_spec < 31.39ms → our SPEC path is making TPOT worse → fix spec overhead, not add drafts. If T_no_spec > 31.39ms → base decode cost problem, spec alone can't save. MUST measure.
  - Also: measured E2 + token-accounting (does nd=2 include a bonus token?) changes the math; measure actual E2, don't assume.
- **DECISION GATE → run full-serve draft-count sweep** (num-drafts 2 vs 3, GATE_FORCE output-pinned, current main): does more drafts net-win TPOT + what is real p1/p2 accept. This settles L6 viability.
- **★ NOMENCLATURE RESOLVED + REAL ACCEPTANCE (2026-07-24, d2 serve logs):** `--num-drafts N` → verify width **K=N+1**. So SHIPPING `--num-drafts 2` is ALREADY **K=3** (`verify_k3_step`). "Unlock K=3" was a misframing — K=3 (2-draft) is the shipping 39.95ms config. My d3 leg (--num-drafts 3) = K=4. The old "K=3 worse 56-59ms" runs were --num-drafts 3 = K=4.
  - **Real production acceptance** (NOT the assumed 0.90/0.53): **p1≈0.72** (0.61-0.79), **p2_cond≈0.58** (0.52-0.70), **mean accepted≈1.1-1.3 tok/step → E≈2.15**. Per 100 steps: ~34-53% accept-2, ~25-35% accept-1, ~21-39% reject.
  - **L6 REFRAMED:** not "unlock K=3" (already shipping) but "fuse the SHIPPING K=3 conv/norm epilogue (currently per-token, 40% of GDN verify) to cut per-step COST." Cost-axis lever on the live config. Magnitude of win = fraction of total step that epilogue is (needs full-serve attribution; GDN verify is only part of the step).
  - **Acceptance is the deeper story:** p1≈0.72 (not 0.90) means the drafter is the ceiling. Raising p1→0.9/p2→0.7 → E≈2.53 (+18%) → ~34ms; beating 31.39 needs E≈2.73 → very high accept = a TRAINED drafter (EAGLE-3), a separate project.
- **dgx3 L6 IMPLEMENTATION MAP (2026-07-24):** L6 (fuse shipping-K=3 conv/norm epilogue) needs **ZERO new kernels** — `gdn_verify_fused_conv_kn` (ships @K=17) already snapshots positions 0..K-2; fused-norm body is K-general (only launcher hardcodes grid.y=2). L6 = ~30-40 LoC Rust dispatch (3 files: trait_decode_batched_conv_gdn.rs conv arm, ssm_mamba.rs norm num_positions param, gate generalize), ~0.5 day, low-med risk. 500-LoC-cap: conv_gdn file already 528 → extract shared helper. Accuracy: extend gdn_verify_fused_microtest to K=3, cos≥0.99999. M≤4 projection GEMVs (lm_head/QKV/O) ALREADY in main. Map: dgx3:/workspace/decode_profile_20260724_020525/L6_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md. **BUT: cost isn't the K=3 blocker (accept is), and L1(K=2 fusion) was e2e-neutral → expect L6 similarly small. Cheap byte-identical cost-cut worth banking, NOT the 40→31 closer.**
- **★★★ CORRECTION (2026-07-24): WARM acceptance is ALREADY ~0.90 on the real workload.** My single-turn ab_probe measured COLD (p1 0.72, mean-acc 1.15) — carry cannot adopt across independent prompts, so it was unrepresentative. dgx2 LIVE agentic e2e (multi-turn, real): **p1 0.89-0.99, p2_cond 0.84-0.92, mean accepted ~1.8 tok/step (E~2.8)** — matches strix 90%. So the drafter/refeed/carry IS working on GB10; **acceptance is NOT the wall.** My earlier "acceptance ceiling / trained drafter needed" verdict is RETRACTED. The `mtp_carry.rs` cold-turn refeed fix is live and effective on warm turns (987/1007 samples warm).
  - **Reframe (correct this time):** with E~2.8 already, TPOT 39.95ms ⇒ per-step cost S~112ms. Gap to 31.39ms is now **per-step DECODE COST (~-21% needed)** — dense-27B is memory-bound (weights streamed each K=3 verify pass). Fused epilogue (L6) is marginal vs the model-forward cost; need full-serve step attribution to find the real cost slices. Also verify the 39.95ms itself (cold-turn drag on the median vs warm steady-state).
  - K=4 sweep: nd2(K3)=43.13ms vs nd3(K4)=55.11ms (+27.8%) → K=4 regresses, K=3 is the sweet spot. Consistent (3rd draft marginal, more cost).
- **qwen RECONSULT / per-step teardown (2026-07-24):** COST is the wall (confirmed). Acceptance ~0.90 gives only ~7% headroom (E 2.8/3.0) → even perfect K=3 floors at **37.3ms, still misses 31.39**. Need **−21% per-step cost** (S 112→88ms). WY recurrence is NOT the suspect (L1 dead confirms epilogue≠wall). **Ranked overhead hypotheses:** #1 (30%) **non-overlapped drafter/MTP proposal** (2 sequential MTP passes not hidden behind verify; predict mtp_propose ≥18-25ms/step) · #2 (25%) **target verify not weight-once at M=3** (projections/FFN stream per-token or inefficient M=3; predict M=3 >1.3× M=1) · #3 (20%) launch/dispatch bubbles (predict GPU idle ≥12-15ms/step) · #4 (15%) SSM state/rollback D2D · #5 (10%) measurement artifact. **Method:** Step0 per-step phase split (NVTX/CUDA-events: target_verify/mtp_propose/sample/ssm-rollback/gaps) ← decisive; Step1 non-spec T_no_spec leg (decision tree); Step2 SHORT safe nsys on ONE warm decode loop (dgx3 idle, --delay/--duration, NOT full 1007); Step3 microbench M=1 vs M=3 projections/FFN/lm_head + GDN state traffic. Falsifier to confirm: live nd=2 dispatches batched wy3 (YES, seen in logs) and M=3 GEMVs truly batched. **L6 verdict: worth banking as small cost-cut but NOT the closer (epilogue is 2-6ms not 20+).**
- **L1 `AVAROK_GDN_FUSED_VERIFY`: DEAD** (2026-07-24). base_off 42.87ms vs fused_on 43.12ms warm-median TPOT (+0.6%, noise; 9 runs/leg). Output BYTE-IDENTICAL (sha f0fdf42b, correctness confirmed). At K=2 the conv/norm epilogue is a small fraction of the verify step → fusing saves ~nothing. DO NOT FOLD. Lesson: reducing K=2 verify COST doesn't move TPOT; the lever is tokens-accepted-per-step (→ L6 unlock-K=3).
- Neighbour: idle ollama gpt-oss-120b on :8000, model NOT resident (111GB free) — no contention.

## ★★★★ RE-BASELINE (2026-07-24) — the vLLM reference was a WEAK/verbose run
User confirmed a WELL-CONFIGURED vLLM-on-GB10 (same nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4 ckpt):
  Perf(1007): wall **5361s**, IoU **0.6269**, tps 14.6, qps 0.188, 1006/0 missing.
  Accuracy(995 ST): **86.43%** overall / 88.77 normalized. Gate PASS.
vs the artifact I anchored on (vllm_edge_full_20260716): wall 7438s, IoU 0.6194, BFCL 79.90,
TTFT 2985, TPOT 31.39, TPS 18.68. The 07-16 run was VERBOSE (~521 tok/BFCL leg per CLAUDE.md) →
slow wall + weak BFCL. **The confirmed 5361/86.43/0.6269 is the REAL bar.**
Re-scored vs REAL vLLM: Avarok golden (~5000s / ~87 / ~0.625) ≈ **PARITY** on wall/BFCL/IoU
(all within noise), NOT a 4/5 blowout. **TTFT/TPOT of the confirmed run are UNKNOWN** → the
31.39ms target is from the weak run and may be invalid. MUST obtain confirmed-run TTFT/TPOT before
grinding any decode-cost lever. dgx2 Avarok e2e gives the apples-to-apples Perf/Accuracy phases.

## L6 result: DO-NOT-FOLD
Byte-identical (sha match), TPOT delta -0.01% (noise). Epilogue fusion dead on GB10 (conv snapshot
copies ~0.14% of decode GPU time), same as L1. Refactor dropped conv_gdn file 528→495 LoC (dedups
K4/K17) — cleanup value only. NOT committed/folded.

## ★★★★★ PHASE 0 VERDICT (tree-spec plan, 2026-07-24): GO — via CHAIN-WIDENING
Shadow top-k measurement (warm agentic, K=4, 19,139 joined positions, spine-mismatch 0.4%):
| depth | cond.top1 | top2 | top4 | miss |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.909 | 0.941 | 0.951 | 4.9% |
| 2 | 0.903 | 0.951 | 0.968 | 3.2% |
| 3 | 0.881 | 0.934 | 0.955 | 4.5% |
**The depth cliff does not exist warm** (old p2~0.53-0.65 = cold/blind-drafter artifact). Conditional
top-1 plateaus 0.88-0.91 → hedges buy little (misses are outside top-4); DEEP CHAINS compound:
enumerator best = **chain-K8 E=5.58 → TPOT ~21ms**; chain-K6 ~25ms; best tree 24.9ms (M=6 pure spine
= itself a chain). Tree uplift over chain **−17.3%** → per the plan's decision rule + user-approved
fallback: **build CHAIN-WIDENING** (batch8 GEMV + wy5-8 GDN + verify_k6/k8). Robustness: s4+=0.75 →
K8 E=4.93 (24ms); s4+=0.60 → E=4.40 (27ms) — <30ms under all extrapolations.
Immediate free check: measured depth-3 implies WARM K=4 (shipping kernels, --num-drafts 3) E≈3.45 →
~33ms. The earlier "K=4 regresses +27.8%" sweep was COLD single-turn (cold drafter ~0.72/0.5) — warm
A/B now running to validate. Artifacts: shadow_topk_stats.json, shadow_lines.log, scripts/.

## ★★★★★ ROOT CAUSE: "K=4 regresses" = MISSING n==4 FFN ARM (dispatch gap, 2026-07-24)
Warm K3-vs-K4 A/B (prose probe): K3 44.77ms vs K4 58.22ms (+30%). At similar accept (E 2.20 vs 2.39)
→ **S4/S3 ≈ 1.41×** — NOT weight-once. Diagnosis: `multi_seq/ffn.rs` arm ladder has n==3→forward_k3,
n==2→forward_k2, else dense → **forward_prefill (MMQ GEMM, ~156 GB/s cliff)**. NO n==4 arm — so K=4
verify runs the 16 full-attn layers' FFN on the cliff. `forward_k4` EXISTS (dense_ffn.rs:1123, 54.8ms
→ ~31ms per its own docstring) and is wired for the 48 GDN layers (trait_decode_batched.rs:668) but
was never added to the attention multi-seq path. **Explains every historical K=4 regression** (cold
sweep +27.8%, old nd=3 e2e 56-59ms). Fix = mirror the n==3 arm (kernel agent folding it in).
ALSO: acceptance is workload-dependent — prose probe p1 0.63-0.72 vs agentic-harness shadow 0.88-0.91.
The MLPerf target workload is agentic → shadow numbers govern the goal; freeform prose will see less.
With the n==4 fix alone: predicted agentic K=4 TPOT ≈ 33-34ms (E≈3.45, S4/S3≈1.02) on TODAY'S kernels.

## ★★★ K=6 STRUCTURAL VALIDATION: PASS (2026-07-24)
`--num-drafts 5` on today's binary runs end-to-end: MTP drafter proposes 5-deep, dispatch routes to
step_verify_dflash (γ=5) with the MTP pipeline branch, acceptance works (0-5/5 incl. 100% steps),
output coherent, no errors/degrades. Warm prose TPOT 96.9ms = expected cliff-stack (n>4 FFN→
forward_prefill MMQ on 16 attn layers + M=6 lm_head/QKV GEMM + serial GDN): S6/S3 ≈ 3.1×. All of it
is the in-flight batch8/gate work. **Chain K≤8 needs NO new structural code — only the kernels.**
Prose accept at depth5 mean ≈ 2.2/5 (E≈3.2 even on the pessimistic workload).

## ★★★★★ CHAIN-WIDENING RESULT (2026-07-24): K=4 = 31.69ms TPOT — vLLM-tuned parity, −17.7%
Subset ladder (174-turn agentic, same seed, wyN binary): K3 38.49 / **K4 31.69** / K5 32.76 (best
wall 734s + tps 20.12 + TTFT 1212) / K6-wy6 32.29 / K8 34.64. Winner **K=4 (--num-drafts 3)**: the
n==4 FFN fix delivered the entire jump; deeper K flattens (depth-4+ accept below plateau + drafter
propose cost; wy6-vs-serial ≈ noise, GDN 1.6% of step as profiled). Sub-30 NOT reached via chains —
31.69 ≈ vLLM-tuned 31.39 (+0.95%) = raw-decode PARITY with the best-tuned vLLM, from 38-40 shipping.
Gates: batch8 bit-exact ×3 refs; wyN cos-gate PASS K5-8; K3 control 38.49 = baseline (no regression).
FOLDED: ff-merge feat/tree-spec-decode → perf/decode-fold-2026-07-24, pushed @5fc590fe.
GOLDEN E2E (submission handoff): launched ND=3, frozen c2final env, both phases. K=5 noted as the
wall/tps/TTFT-optimal alternative within noise.

## ★★★★★ GOLDEN E2E RESULT (K=4, 2026-07-24) — SHIPPED
Full MLCommons both-phase, golden/frozen c2final config, only `--num-drafts 2→3`:
