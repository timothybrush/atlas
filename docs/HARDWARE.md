# Adding a new hardware target or model family

Atlas's compute stack is structured around **(hardware, model, quant) tuples**.
Each tuple is a self-contained body of work: kernels are written, tuned, and
tested per-tuple. This document explains how to extend the matrix.

## Directory layout

```
kernels/
└── <hardware>/                    e.g. gb10
    ├── HARDWARE.toml              arch, sm, fp32-residual flag
    ├── <quant>/                   shared kernels for this hw + quant
    │   └── *.cu                   e.g. nvfp4/dense_gemm.cu
    └── <model>/                   per-model overrides
        ├── MODEL.toml             model_type list, sampling presets, behavior
        └── <quant>/               per-(model, quant) overrides
            └── *.cu               e.g. qwen3.6-35b-a3b/nvfp4/inferspark_prefill_h128.cu
```

The build script (`crates/atlas-kernels/build.rs`) walks this tree and
compiles every `.cu` to PTX. Model-specific files override shared
files when a name collision occurs.

## Adding a new model family

If your model is similar to an existing one (e.g., adding Qwen3.7 to the
Qwen3.5/3.6 family), the mechanical recipe is:

1. **Create the kernel target dir**:
   ```
   kernels/gb10/qwen3.7-XXB/
   ├── MODEL.toml                  copy from a similar model's MODEL.toml
   └── nvfp4/                      or fp8/ etc. depending on the quant
       └── (per-target overrides — leave empty if shared kernels suffice)
   ```

2. **Write `MODEL.toml`**:
   ```toml
   [model]
   name = "qwen3.7-XXB"
   hf_id = "Qwen/Qwen3.7-XXB"
   params = "XXB"
   active_params = "XXB"
   architecture = "Hybrid Attention + GDN + Dense FFN"

   [[model_types]]
   model_type = "qwen3_5"          # what the HF config.json says
   hidden_size = NNNN              # exact hidden dim — wins over wildcards

   # Only if ANOTHER target declares the same (model_type, hidden_size) —
   # e.g. qwen3.8-27b's config is bit-identical to qwen3.6-27b's — declare
   # checkpoint-reference needles so runtime resolution can break the tie
   # (case-insensitive substrings of the HF id / --model-name / model dir).
   # build.rs FAILS if colliding targets omit this, and a tie the needles
   # cannot break to exactly one target is a hard startup error (never a
   # build-order pick; `--kernel-target` pins explicitly). Rules + rationale:
   # crates/atlas-kernels/src/resolve.rs.
   # match_names = ["qwen3.7-XXb"]

   # Architecturally-identical sibling (zero new kernels)? Reuse another
   # target's .cu tree instead of copying it — qwen3.8-27b compiles
   # qwen3.6-27b's sources this way and ships no files of its own:
   # kernel_source = "qwen3.6-27b"

   [behavior]
   default_num_drafts = 1
   max_thinking_budget = 512
   thinking_in_tools = false

   [sampling.thinking_text]
   temperature = 0.6
   top_p = 0.95
   top_k = 20

   # ... (other sampling presets — see existing MODEL.toml files)
   ```

3. **Wire to a `WeightLoader`** in `crates/spark-model/src/factory.rs`:
   most Qwen3-family models share `Qwen35WeightLoader` for MoE and
   `Qwen35DenseWeightLoader` for dense FFN. Pick the right one based on
   whether the model has experts.

4. **Add to test sweep** (`tests/run_all_models.py`): one round per
   variant (with/without MTP, EP=2 if applicable).

5. **Build with the wildcard target**:
   ```
   ATLAS_TARGET_MODEL='*' cargo build --release -p spark-server
   ```
   The new target compiles into the binary; runtime selects it via
   `model_type` + `hidden_size` matching, with `match_names` breaking any
   tie between config-identical checkpoints (see
   `crates/atlas-kernels/src/resolve.rs`).

If your model is genuinely new (different attention pattern, novel SSM
variant, etc.), you'll also need to:
6. Write a per-architecture `TransformerLayer` impl in
   `crates/spark-model/src/layers/` (mirror the structure of
   `qwen3_attention/` or `qwen3_ssm/`).
7. Add a new `WeightLoader` in `crates/spark-model/src/weight_loader/`
   if the safetensors key naming differs from existing families.

## Adding a new hardware target

Atlas currently targets only **GB10 (Blackwell, sm_121)**. Adding another
target (say sm_120a for an RTX PRO 6000 workstation card, sm_90a for Hopper,
or sm_100a for B200) requires:

1. **`kernels/<new-hw>/HARDWARE.toml`**:
   ```toml
   [hardware]
   arch = "blackwell"              # or "hopper", "ampere", etc.
   sm = 100                        # compute capability
   use_fp32_residual = false       # GB10 quirk; usually false
   ```

2. **Per-quant kernel directory**: `kernels/<new-hw>/nvfp4/`,
   `kernels/<new-hw>/fp8/`. Most kernels can be ported from `gb10/` but
   need recompilation with the new SM target. Tile shapes, SMEM budget,
   and tensor-core MMA instructions may need tuning.

3. **`atlas-kernels/build.rs`**: usually no changes needed — the build
   script auto-discovers new `kernels/<hw>/` directories.

4. **`spark-runtime/src/cuda_backend.rs`**: if the hardware has different
   capabilities (e.g., GDS supported, no NVLink, different RDMA NIC),
   wire the relevant flags here.

5. **NCCL env**: launchers like `scripts/start-ep2.sh` hardcode
   `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=enp1s0f0np0` (GB10's RDMA NIC). Update for the
   new hardware's interconnect.

6. **CI**: GitHub Actions runs on `ubuntu-latest` with `ATLAS_SKIP_BUILD=1`
   so no GPU is needed. The new target compiles via the wildcard build
   on a host with the right SM.

## Adding a new quantization scheme

Atlas supports NVFP4 (E2M1 + FP8 scales), FP8 block-scaled, BF16 raw.
To add a new scheme (e.g., MX4, INT4):

1. **`crates/atlas-core/src/config.rs`**: extend the quant detection
   logic to recognize the new format from `quantization_config` in
   `config.json`.
2. **`crates/spark-model/src/weight_map/`**: add a loader function
   that produces the right `QuantizedWeight` variant.
3. **Per-model kernels**: write `*.cu` for the new quant under
   `kernels/gb10/<model>/<new-quant>/`. The build script auto-picks them.
4. **Dispatch**: `crates/spark-model/src/layers/<layer>/` per-quant
   branches in the forward path.

## PTX arch suffix and the static shared-memory ceiling

The arch string in `HARDWARE.toml` decides more than which GPU the PTX runs
on. `ptxas` enforces a per-target ceiling on **static** `__shared__`
allocations, and on Blackwell that ceiling depends on the suffix, not the
chip. Measured with CUDA 13.0.88 (`nvcc --ptx` then `ptxas`) by bisecting a
single `__shared__ char buf[N]` at 48 KiB, 100 KiB and 228 KiB:

| arch string | static `__shared__` ceiling |
|---|---|
| `sm_120a`, `sm_121a` (arch-specific) | `0x18c00` = 99 KiB |
| `sm_120`, `sm_121`, `sm_121f` (plain or family) | `0xc000` = 48 KiB |
| `sm_90a` | `0x38c00` = 227 KiB |

`nvcc --ptx` accepts an oversized static array on every target; only `ptxas`
(or the driver JIT at `cuModuleLoadData`) rejects it, with `Entry function
'...' uses too much shared data`. A green `cargo build` therefore does not
prove a kernel assembles: the build runs `nvcc --ptx` only. The dynamic
opt-in (`MAX_DYNAMIC_SHARED_SIZE_BYTES`) does not rescue a fixed-size array;
only `extern __shared__` allocations use it.

Consequence for gb10: its `sm_121f` target keeps one build portable across
future 12.x parts, and pays for it with the 48 KiB ceiling. The BR=64
prefill variants (`inferspark_prefill*`, `prefill_paged_compute*.cuh`) declare
70 to 90 KiB of static shared memory and are rejected for `sm_121f` while the
same source assembles for `sm_121a` and `sm_120a`. Moving gb10 to `sm_121a`
is a portability trade, not a bug fix, so it is a deliberate decision rather
than something to change while adding a target.

## Testing a new target

Once compiled:

```bash
# Smoke test
docker run --gpus all --ipc=host -p 8888:8888 \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  atlas-gb10:latest \
  serve <new-model-hf-id> --max-seq-len 4096 --max-batch-size 1

curl http://localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"...","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'

# Coherence + tool calls + long context
python3 tests/single_gpu_suite.py --url http://localhost:8888 --model <new-model-hf-id>

# Regression sweep
python3 tests/run_all_models.py
```

The sweep harness saves per-model JSONs to `tests/all_models_results/`
that you can diff against the pre-merge baseline (`tests/all_models_results.pre-refactor/`).

## Reference implementations

When in doubt, copy from a model with similar arch:

| New model is... | Look at |
|---|---|
| Hybrid SSM + attention MoE | `qwen3.5-35b-a3b/`, `qwen3.6-35b-a3b/` |
| Hybrid SSM + attention dense | `qwen3.5-27b/`, `qwen3.6-27b/` |
| Pure Mamba2 + MoE | `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b/` |
| Pure attention + MoE | `mistral-small-4/`, `minimax-m2-229b/` |
| Pure attention dense | `gemma-4-31b/` |
| Vision-language | `qwen3-vl-30b-a3b/` |
