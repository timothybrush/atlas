// Atlas Dense BF16 batched GEMV (M rows) for SM121 (GB10).
//
// The M-row generalisation of dense_gemv_bf16_batch2: computes M output rows
// from ONE pass over the BF16 weight matrix, so weight bandwidth is paid once
// instead of M times. Bit-identical to running dense_gemv_bf16 M times — each
// row's accumulator follows the exact same K-iteration order and reduction
// tree; the extra rows only add independent accumulators over the same loop.
// (KERNEL.toml builds this dir with --fmad=false, which is what makes that
// identity hold rather than merely "close".)
//
//   C[t, n] = dot(A[t, :], B[n, :])   for t in [0, M)
//
//   A: [M, K] BF16 (activation rows, contiguous — this is exactly the layout
//      the multi-seq decode path already has: `normed.offset(i * h * bf16)`)
//   B: [N, K] BF16 (weights, row-major)
//   C: M rows at C + t * out_stride (BF16 elements)
//
// `out_stride` decouples the output row stride from N so callers can write
// straight into per-token strided layouts (e.g. the multi-seq qkv buffer,
// whose rows are `per_seq_qkv` apart, not `N` apart).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: at decode, Laguna's q/k/v/o and shared-expert projections
// are BF16 (the checkpoint ships them unquantized and they stay that way), and
// the BF16 path had no batched tier — only the quantized paths did
// (w4a16_gemv_batch2/3/4, w8a16_gemv_batch2/4). So every sequence in a decode
// batch re-read the whole weight matrix, making 54% of the decode step scale
// linearly with concurrency.
//
// A tile-based GEMM is the wrong tool here: at M<=4 an M64-tile GEMM is ~94%
// padding, and was measured 3.6x SLOWER than the batched GEMV on this exact
// workload (see the note in multi_seq/qkv.rs::wide_verify_gemm).
//
// THE A TILE LIVES IN SHARED MEMORY. The four output groups in a block walk the
// SAME `kv` sequence, so each of them was re-reading identical `A[t][kv]` — 4x
// redundant, and at M=8 that is EIGHT activation loads issued per ONE weight load.
// While `m * K * 2` fits L1 those hit cache and cost only issue slots; once it
// overflows L1 they all fall to L2 and the kernel becomes L2-bound rather than
// DRAM-bound, which is where the measured bandwidth collapses (145 GB/s at
// N=4096 K=16384 against 213 GB/s at K=3072 on the same part). Staging the tile
// once per block per 64-`kv` chunk removes both effects.
//
// 🪤 This does NOT touch the arithmetic. Same `kv` order per row, same lo-then-hi
// add order, same 64-thread stride, same warp-shuffle tree, same 2-warp fold —
// the values reaching the FMUL/FADD chain are the same bits, just fetched
// differently. Measured bit-identical to the previous revision on 64 (N, K)
// shapes and on M = 1..8 (`scripts/glm53-dense-bf16/bench_dense_bf16.cu`,
// spark-bench). Measured 1.02-1.50x depending on shape; 1.12x weighted by the
// 9000-token GLM prefill's own launch histogram.
//
// 🪤 The old `if (n >= N) return;` is now a mask, not a return: threads in a
// partial last block have to reach the staging barriers with everyone else.
//
// Grid: (ceil(N / 4), 1, 1)   Block: (256, 1, 1)

// 🔴 16, NOT 8. The cap was never arithmetic: `acc[t]` is one independent FP32 chain per
// row over the same `kv` order, `m` appears in no row's operand sequence, and the reduce
// is per-`t`. So a wider tier is bit-identical to the narrow one AND to M serial
// `dense_gemv_bf16` calls — widening it only changes how much weight traffic each token
// pays for. MEASURED on the 12 real GLM-5.3 prefill shapes with cold weights
// (`scripts/glm53-dense-bf16/bench_m16.cu`, spark-bench): every row byte-identical to the
// M=1 kernel at M=16, every m <= 8 byte-identical to the MAX_M=8 kernel this replaces
// (the gate that matters — decode, the MTP verify and the lm_head arm all run m <= 8 on
// this same kernel), and per-token cost 1.36-1.98x lower on 11 of the 12 shapes.
//
// 🪤 The one shape that LOSES is shallow-K: N4096 K128 goes 0.77x, because at K_VEC = 16
// the staging barriers dominate a kernel that barely reads anything. It costs ~0.27 s of a
// ~17.6 s win, so it is not worth a special case — but do not generalise "wider is faster"

// 6 blocks/SM against the 100 KB/SM on GB10, so occupancy is not the limiter.
