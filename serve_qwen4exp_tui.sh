# Serve Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (model_type qwen4_exp) — port tracked in Avarok #753.
#
# ⚠ SERVING IS NOT WIRED YET. This currently gets as far as LOADING: the
# hyper-connection residual, the QSA indexer and the PLE n-gram injection are
# unimplemented and refuse by name at the forward boundary. Use this to
# exercise the loader and read the alloc ledger, not to generate text.
#
# PRIMARY CHECKPOINT is the Inferact NVFP4 release. Against RadixArk's it has
# the same architecture and the same per-expert ModelOpt NVFP4 layout, but
# keeps the PLE n-gram tables in BF16 rather than FP8 — simpler to load (no
# dequant) and more accurate (on LongCat, BF16 n-gram rows measured 0.0050
# error against the reference vs FP8's 0.0247). It costs 170 GB on disk
# against 126 GB, but its RESIDENT footprint is smaller (74.9 vs 78.2 GB)
# because its MTP experts are quantized.
#
#   ./serve_qwen4exp_tui.sh                       # Inferact, port 8889
#   QWEN4EXP_PATH=/path/to/radixark ./serve_qwen4exp_tui.sh
#
# ONE Atlas instance at a time: --gpu-memory-utilization RESERVES its whole
# fraction up front, so a second server fails its OOM pre-flight.

# noise. nsys confirms m256 genuinely RAN (540 calls, 38.1% of GPU time) and
# is ~20% SLOWER PER CALL than the base kernel (31.30 vs 26.17 ms avg) — the
# DRAM-bound microbenchmark that predicted 1.43x does NOT model production.
# The whole +5.1% comes from the QSA tensor-core scorer, not from MoE.
