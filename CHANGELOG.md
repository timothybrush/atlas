## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `spark benchmark <list|run|history>` — the dashboard's benchmark suite as a
  headless subcommand, driving the same executor. Machine-readable output on
  stdout, progress on stderr; exit codes separate a broken harness (1) from a
  failed gate (2).
- `--version`, sourced from the packaged version so a build cannot report a
  version it was not packaged as.

### Fixed
- **Benchmark runs no longer overwrite each other.** History files were named by
  whole seconds, so two runs of the same benchmark within the same second
  silently destroyed the first. Records are now keyed by nanosecond with an
  explicit collision guard.
- Run history records the parameters, target, source and version alongside the
  result. Previously only the result was stored, so a number could not be
  attributed to a configuration or reproduced. Pre-existing files still load.

### Added
- **Six Hopper-owned decode kernels under `kernels/hopper/common`**, declared in
  that target's `[kernels] overrides`. Three REPLACE their GB10 namesakes — the
  W8A16 M=1 decode GEMV family, which on an H100 is 71% of the single-stream
  decode step and was LSU-bound on a shared-memory E4M3 LUT gather rather than
  bandwidth-bound. The override decodes with `cvt.rn.f16x2.e4m3x2` and keeps
  four chunk loads in flight: **C=1 TPOT 17.87 → 14.14 ms (−20.9%)** on
  1×H100 80 GB with `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8`, 1.66–2.05× per shape, 2,689 GB/s on
  the fused gate+up — and **bit-identical**, `unequal=0` on all seven production
  shapes. GB10's own sources are untouched and still compiled by gb10, b200,
  strix and strix-hip.
  Three are ADDITIONS with new stems: `w8a16_gemm_m16.cu`,
  `dense_gemm_m16_bf16.cu` and `w8a16_gemv_ncol.cu`, the m16n8k16 tensor-core
  tiers for 5..32-row decode. They are **not** in `kernels/gb10`, so a GB10
  build does not compile a kernel it has no receipt for.

### Changed
- **Five `[defaults]` rows for those tiers, and they do not all say yes.**
  `attn_m16_tc` and `lm_head_m16_tc` are ON for Hopper (+5.3% and +4.1% C=16
  aggregate), `ffn_m16_tc` is OFF on a measured LOSS (−5.2%) from the same
  kernel on a different projection family, and `attn_ncol_gemv` is OFF because
  no serving A/B exists for it on any target. Hopper's `lm_head_batchm_max`
  widens 8 → 16, in the same commit as the arm it was measured beside. Every
  row is off (or the frozen baseline) on GB10 and B200, so neither target's
  serve changes.
### Changed
- **The tensor-core GDN chunked-prefill family is ON by default on Hopper.**
  `kernels/hopper/HARDWARE.toml` `[defaults] gdn_prefill_tc = true` — the state
  spine and both Hopper prefill remnant twins. H100 round 13 measured it on one
  binary against a same-round control: C=1 TTFT 269.1 → 162.4 ms on 1193/256 and
  889.3 → 491.5 ms on 4593/512, C=16 aggregate +21.5% / +31.4%, coherency 4/4,
  determinism 8/8 identical over three runs, and nsys pricing the two twins at
  4.28× (`chunk_fwd_o_hopper`) and 1.60× (`recompute_wu_hopper`) with the shared
  spine kernel unchanged at 0.99× as the internal control. `kernels/gb10` and
  `kernels/b200` keep `false` — this is an H100 receipt. `ATLAS_GDN_PREFILL_TC=0`
  turns the whole family off and `ATLAS_NO_GDN_PREFILL_TC_REMNANTS=1` keeps the
  spine while pinning the twins to their parents; both print on the serve's
  `target defaults (hopper): …` line. Numbers: `GDN-PREFILL-ATTRIBUTION.md`.
- **Serving defaults are now per-hardware-target and live in the repository.**
  `kernels/<hw>/HARDWARE.toml` gained a `[defaults]` table, baked into the
  binary by `build.rs` as `atlas_kernels::TARGET_DEFAULTS`. A kernel-path lever
  that differs between one target and another resolves from that declaration
  FIRST and the environment second, so a serve reproduces its measured
  configuration with no `ATLAS_*` prefix at all, and prints one
  `target defaults (<hw>): …` line naming every resolved value and which of them
  came from the environment. GB10's declaration restates the previous hardcoded
  defaults exactly, asserted as an equality in
  `atlas-kernels/tests/target_defaults.rs`, so GB10 behaviour is unchanged. The
  first lever to differ is `ssm_batched_recurrent`, which `kernels/hopper`
  declares ON.
- **`ATLAS_SSM_BATCHED_RECURRENT=0` now means OFF.** It was read as `== "1"`,
  so `=0` was indistinguishable from absent — which cannot express "off" once a
  target's default can be ON, leaving an operator no way to turn a lever off
  without editing a launch script. `VAR=1` is unchanged, and the `ATLAS_NO_*`
  kill switches stay presence-gated. `ATLAS_GDN_PREFILL_TC` joins it as
  `[defaults] gdn_prefill_tc`: it was presence-gated, so `=0` used to mean ON
  and now means OFF. Every A/B recipe for it set `=1` and is unaffected.
- `kernels/<hw>/HARDWARE.toml` also gained `[hardware] sm_count`, cross-checked
  at boot against the driver's `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_MULTIPROCESSOR_COUNT`; a
  mismatch logs one warning naming both numbers and serving continues.

### Added

- DeepSeek-V4-Flash support on GB10: native MXFP4 (E8M0) routed-expert
  loading (transcode-free — no MXFP4→BF16→NVFP4 double-quant) plus the
  Phase-K E8M0 GEMM kernels, end-to-end. (#293)
- `/v1/completions` legacy-API parity: `echo`, integer `logprobs` (four
  parallel-array `CompletionLogprobs` block), `n`, `stream_options`, and
  accepted-but-ignored `user`/`suffix`/`best_of`; prompt-position logprob
  collection during prefill. (#291)
- Native U8 NVFP4 loading for pre-quantized checkpoints. (#257)
- Holo-3.1-35B-A3B / Holo-3.1-0.8B / Ornith-1.0-9B model support on GB10
  (sm_121): hybrid Gated-DeltaNet + full-attention + (256-expert MoE | dense
  FFN) + Qwen3-VL vision tower. Brings CUTLASS Sm120 NVFP4 grouped MoE, FLA
  chunked-scan GDN prefill + wmma DV-block decode, cuBLASLt/CUTLASS attention
  projections, kernel-batched co-dispatch prefill, radix-KV + Marconi
  SSM-snapshot prefix caching, and self-relative auto KV budget. (#203)
- GEMM-based Qwen3-VL ViT attention kernel (tensor-core SDPA replacing the
  warp-per-query kernel) + tensor-core ViT block GEMMs + batched multi-image
  forward — ~2× image-request TTFT on GB10. (#202)

### Fixed

- SSM snapshot eviction is now recency-only: the hit-weighted score was
  pinning fossil anchors and inflating warm TTFT; the pure-LRU/winner-only
  policy restores warm-TTFT parity with llama.cpp. (3d8130d0)
- 35B agentic-wall recipe: SSM tail-protect brings webserver_ok
  Σ(wall_time) from 2765s to 1364s (<1500s gate). (#278)
- Weight-only NVFP4 (W4A16) checkpoints now load. llm-compressor
  `nvfp4-pack-quantized` with `input_activations: None` ships no static
  activation scale; the loader previously required `input_global_scale` and
  failed (e.g. `AEON-7/Ornith-1.0-35B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-NVFP4`). The
  field is loaded-but-unused (activations are quantized dynamically), so it is
  now optional. W4A4/W4A8 checkpoints are unaffected. (#203)
- `--gpu-memory-utilization` now enforces a hard ceiling on total GPU
  memory (weights + buffers + KV cache + reserves), matching the vLLM /
  sparkrun convention.  Previously the fraction was applied only to
  post-weight free memory, causing the KV cache to over-allocate by
  20-27 GB when values below the ~0.88 default were used.  This blocked
  multi-service co-residency on shared-memory systems (e.g. DGX Spark
  GB10).  The flag now behaves as documented: `0.50` on a 120 GB device
  caps Atlas at ~60 GB total.  (#180)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-06

Initial public release. Atlas is a pure-Rust LLM inference engine
targeting NVIDIA GB10 (DGX Spark, SM121) with twelve hand-tuned
(Hardware × Model × Quantization) targets.

### Added

- Pure-Rust runtime — no Python, no PyTorch — for hybrid Attention +
  SSM/GDN/Mamba-2 architectures with NVFP4 / FP8 / BF16 quantization.
- 35 hyperoptimized CUDA kernels per target, compiled to PTX and
  embedded in the binary at build time. Multi-model image dispatches
  the right kernel set at startup from `config.json`.
- OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible HTTP API (`/v1/chat/completions`,
  `/v1/responses`, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/conversations`,
  `/tokenize`, `/detokenize`, `/health`, `/metrics`).
- Tool calling with grammar-constrained decoding (Hermes,
  Qwen3-Coder, Mistral, MiniMax-XML formats).
- MTP speculative decoding (K=2 pipelined verify), self-speculative
  layer-skipping, and N-gram speculative decoding.
- Prefix caching: radix-tree (RadixAttention) + SSM snapshot cache
  (Marconi-style). 10× warm-cache TTFT reduction.
- KV cache dtypes: BF16, FP8, NVFP4, turbo3, turbo4. Optional
  per-layer high-precision overlay (`--kv-high-precision-layers`).
- Multi-GPU expert parallelism (EP=2 over RoCEv2) for models that
  exceed a single GB10's weight budget (122B-class, MiniMax M2.7).
- Vision encoder (Qwen3-VL, Qwen3.6 ViT).
- High-speed NVMe KV swap (sliding-window, io_uring) for
  long-context decoding past the HBM cap.
- Bearer-token authentication (`--require-auth` +
  `--auth-tokens-file`), constant-time validated. Default bind is
  `127.0.0.1`; `--bind 0.0.0.0` warns when used.
- Twelve supported (GB10, model, quant) targets across Qwen3.5 /
  Qwen3.6 / Qwen3-Next / Qwen3-VL / Gemma-4 / Mistral-Small-4 /
  MiniMax-M2.7 / Nemotron-H families.
- mdBook documentation at `book/src/`, rustdoc at `target/doc/`,
  Docker image `avarok/atlas-gb10:latest`.
