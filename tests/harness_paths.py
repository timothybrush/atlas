"""SSOT for the serve-matrix harness layout, rooted at THIS checkout.

`tests/run_all_models.py` (writer) and `tests/gate_results.py` (reader) must
agree on where results live. They previously each carried their own answer —
the orchestrator held an absolute `/workspace/avarok/tests/...` path into a
DIFFERENT working copy while the gate resolved `dirname(__file__)`. The two
disagreed, so the gate could grade months-old JSON from another checkout as if
it were the current run's output.

Every path here derives from this file's own location, so a worktree, a clone,
or a container copy each get their own results — no absolute path is baked in.
CLI overrides (`--results-dir`, `--baseline-dir`) still win; these are only the
defaults they start from.
