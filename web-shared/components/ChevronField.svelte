<!--
  The ambient Atlas chevron field: one fullscreen triangle, one fragment
  shader. No 3D library, because there is no scene — no graph, no camera
  motion, no materials, no loaders, no picking. ~2.5 KB gzipped including
  the shader; three.js drawing the identical pixels costs ~151 KB. The
  measurement is in lib/gl/FIELD-NOTES.md.

  The canvas paints the ground colour ITSELF (the shader's last line is
  `u_ground + col * amt`), which is why the five colours are read out of the
  cascade here rather than passed as literals: if they were duplicated, a
  token change would show up as a visible seam between the canvas and the
  rest of the page, silently, with nothing failing.

  Put it once in the root layout, above the page content.
