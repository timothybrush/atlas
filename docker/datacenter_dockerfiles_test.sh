# Tests for docker/hopper/Dockerfile, docker/b200/Dockerfile and
# .github/workflows/datacenter-binaries.yml. No Docker daemon, no GPU, no
# network: every case is a structural assertion over files that are checked in.
#
# WHY A TEST AND NOT A REVIEW. None of these three artefacts has ever been
# executed — the images take about an hour to build and need an x86_64 nvcc,
# and the workflow has never been dispatched. What CAN be pinned cheaply is the
# set of properties whose violation would be silent, discovered only on a
# rented GPU:
#
#   (a) the default ATLAS_TARGET_HW per file. Copy one Dockerfile from the
#       other and forget this one line and you get two identical images under
#       two names — a "b200" image full of sm_90a PTX that the arch preflight
#       refuses on a B200, an hour of build time after the mistake.
#   (b) no NCCL_* environment baked in. scripts/start-ep2.sh's block is tuned
#       for two GB10 chassis over RoCE: it names a NIC these boxes do not
#       have, disables NVLink SHARP, and forces the slowest protocol/algorithm
#       pair onto an intra-node transport. On one NVLink node the right NCCL
#       configuration is no NCCL configuration, and a stray ENV would apply it
#       to every rank silently.
#   (c) the NCCL >= 2.28 gate in the runtime stage. Below 2.28 there is no
#       ncclMemAlloc/ncclMemFree symmetric memory, and the failure surfaces as
#       a runtime error inside a fused allreduce, not as a bad image.
#   (d) --features cuda,nccl. Dropping `nccl` still builds and still serves —
#       single GPU. Multi-rank EP/TP is what silently disappears.
#   (e) the workflow's matrix really covers both hardware sets, and its
#       dispatch input offers both. A `both` that resolves to one leg would
#       produce a green run and one artifact.
#
