# Tests for scripts/hopper_ptx_gate.sh. No GPU anywhere: cases (a)-(d) go
# through `--list-tasks`, which resolves the source set and prints it without
# compiling anything, and case (e) cross-compiles one fixture with nvcc/ptxas
# on the host CPU. (e) is SKIPPED, not failed, where no nvcc+ptxas pair is
# installed.
#
# What each case is actually defending:
#
#   (a) `[model] kernel_source` is followed the way the real build follows it.
#       kernels/gb10/qwen3.8-27b/MODEL.toml redirects to qwen3.6-27b, so the
#       compiled set is common/ overridden BY FILE STEM from
#       kernels/gb10/qwen3.6-27b/nvfp4/ -- 181 files, of which 14 are the
#       redirect target's and 4 of those shadow a common kernel (w4a16_gemm,
#       moe_w4a16_grouped_gemm, gated_delta_rule,
#       inferspark_prefill_paged_indirect). A gate that ignored the redirect
#       selected 171 common tasks and reported a green receipt for sources the
#       build never compiles. The oracle is crates/atlas-kernels/build.rs
#       (`kernel_src_dir`, ~line 1065) and build_parse.rs::parse_kernel_source.
#   (b) the redirect is an ALIAS, not a variant: qwen3.8-27b and qwen3.6-27b
#       must select the same source paths. If they ever diverge, one of the two
#       receipts is describing a build that does not happen.
#   (c) qwen3.8-27b's own directory is never a source. It ships MODEL.toml and
#       BENCH.toml and no .cu tree at all; a task pointing into it would be a
#       file that does not exist.
#   (d) a nonexistent model is REFUSED (exit 2), naming what it looked for.
#       Before, an unknown name simply produced the common kernels and
#       attributed them to it -- a receipt for a model that is not in the tree.
#   (e) the ledger records EVERY ptxas error for a file, not just the first.
#       ptxas emits one `error   :` line per rejected entry function, so a file
#       with several rejected entries used to appear in the Failures table as
#       one -- 22 files standing in for 42 rejected entries. The fixture
#       known_bad_two_entries.cu has two oversized-shared entries and one valid
#       one, so `error_count`, `len(errors)` and `summary.rejected_entries` all
#       have a known answer: 2.
#   (f) shellcheck on the gate and on this file.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/hopper_ptx_gate_test.sh
