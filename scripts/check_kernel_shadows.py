"""Kernel Structure Enforcer: validate the kernels/{hw} shadowing layout.

The build (`crates/atlas-kernels/build.rs::collect_cu_files`) resolves each
model's kernel set by file stem: a file in `kernels/{hw}/{model}/{quant}/`
shadows its same-stem namesake in `kernels/{hw}/common/`. This script guards
that mechanism against the two defects that silently corrupt a build:

  RULE 1 (shadow == common): a shadow whose resolved content is byte-identical
    to its common namesake. It overrides nothing useful while masking future
    common/ improvements (shadowing is whole-file, not per-symbol — the
    shadow-drift failure class documented in build.rs). Delete it instead.

  RULE 2 (cross-model duplicate): two or more REGULAR (non-symlink) files
    with the same stem and identical content in different model dirs of one
    hardware set. Divergence-prone copies; the sanctioned sharing mechanism
    is a relative symlink to one canonical file (see
    kernels/gb10/holo-3.1-4b/nvfp4/).

Unique shadows (no matching regular file elsewhere) are valid. Symlinks are
valid regardless of what they point to (they are the sharing mechanism).

NOT CHECKED HERE — dropped entry points. A shadow that keeps its namesake's
name but declares FEWER kernels is the third defect of this family, and the one
that actually shipped (the 27B's four multi-sequence GDN decode kernels, gone
until 2026-07-26). Deciding it needs the entry points a source declares, which
means resolving `#define KERNEL_NAME` + `#include` + token-paste macros, and
then filtering by the per-target `[shadow_exempt]` tables. That resolver is
`crates/atlas-kernels/build_shadow.rs`, and it is enforced by
`crates/atlas-kernels/tests/kernel_shadow_detector.rs` in the same CI run as
this script. Reimplementing it here in Python would be a second, silently
diverging copy of the rule — this note exists so the gap in THIS file reads as
a decision rather than an oversight.

Exit 0 when clean; exit 1 and list every violation otherwise.
