# Fast Rust-only iteration loop. Skips the multi-minute PTX compile
# (AVAROK_SKIP_BUILD=1) and bypasses cudarc's nvcc probe
# (CUDARC_CUDA_VERSION). Use for `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`,
# `cargo clippy --tests`, etc. when you only care about Rust correctness.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check.sh                       # cargo check on the workspace
#   scripts/check.sh clippy --tests        # cargo clippy --tests
#   scripts/check.sh clippy -p spark-server
#
# Anything that needs to actually launch a kernel (Docker build, perf
# tests, runtime smoke) MUST go through the real build path — the stub
# registry produced under AVAROK_SKIP_BUILD has zero PTX.

# `nvcc --version` probe, but it must not claim a version below the repo's
# CUDA 13.0 floor: GB10 is sm_121 and a 12.0 claim describes a toolkit that
# cannot target it.
