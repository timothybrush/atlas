"""Cold-prefill A/B probe for AVAROK_FP4_PREFILL (W4A4 native FP4 MMA dense-FFN prefill).

Prefill is the regime where FP4 activations can pay: M = seqlen >> 8, tiles are full
and the GEMM is compute-bound, unlike decode at M<=8 where activations are <1% of
traffic. This measures whether it actually pays, and what it costs in accuracy.

W4A4 prefill is LOSSY by construction (cos ~0.99 vs fp32), so unlike an
output-neutral change the greedy output hash is EXPECTED to differ. That makes the
token-match rate and the top-logprob KL the real gate, not the sha.

Each prompt is issued cold (a fresh unique preamble defeats the prefix cache and the
session hash), so TTFT is dominated by prefill rather than by a cache hit.

Usage: prefill_w4a4_ab.py <port> <tag> <out.json>
