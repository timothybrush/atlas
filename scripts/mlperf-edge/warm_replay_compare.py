"""Verdict for the AVAROK_GDN_REGRESIDENT A/B.

Two gates, both must hold before this is a fold candidate:

1. TOKEN EQUALITY. The kernel claims cosine 1.0 / max|dH|~1e-8 vs WY4, i.e. it is
   the same acceptance class, not a lossy tradeoff. So the completions must match
   exactly. A mismatch does NOT automatically mean the kernel is wrong — greedy
   spec-decode output is trajectory-dependent — but it removes the "free win"
   framing and forces a full KL/accuracy gate before anything ships.

2. TTFT WIN THAT SCALES WITH DELTA. Replay cost is proportional to the replayed
   suffix, so a real recurrence speedup must grow with delta. A flat offset
   across all deltas is measuring something else (serve noise, admission cost).
   This is the falsifier that separates "the kernel is faster" from "this run was
   faster", and it is why the probe sweeps delta instead of testing one point.
