# Decisive gate for re-enabling AVAROK_SSM_TAIL_MIDCHUNK on the GB10 golden config.
#
# WHY A SECOND ROUND
# The first A/B (ab_midchunk.sh) produced a split verdict that neither leg's
# numbers can settle on their own:
#   * MONOTONIC conversation (warm_tpot_probe, the representative pattern):
#     midchunk ON is BETTER — mean warm TTFT 991 -> 921 ms (-7.1%) and, more
#     tellingly, it converges to a stable ~882 ms floor from turn 4 while OFF
#     oscillates 869-1135 ms. That is the signature of hitting the tail
#     checkpoint every turn instead of intermittently falling further back.
#   * REPLAY probe (warm_replay_probe): midchunk ON is WORSE, 0.76-0.77x at the
#     larger deltas. But that probe alternates back to BASE between reps and
#     there is only ONE tail slot per session (`reserve_tail_slot`), so the
#     alternation thrashes it in a way a forward-only conversation never does.
#     Treated as a probe artifact, not evidence.
#   * TPOT looked +2.2% worse, but the two legs emitted different token counts
#     (286/293/239/... vs 229/210/215/...), so it is trajectory-confounded and
#     is NOT quotable. Spec-decode output is trajectory-dependent by design.
# All of that was N=1 per leg. This script fixes both defects: N reps of the
# monotonic probe, and the accuracy gate that actually matters.
#
# WHY ACCURACY IS THE GATE, NOT LATENCY
# midchunk was disabled on 2026-07-16 for CORRUPTING CROSS-REQUEST SSM prefix
# reuse: BFCL single-turn samples share a system-prompt prefix and reused each
# other's tail snapshot, whose state bleeds past the advertised prefix boundary
# -> garbled tool calls -> wrong scores (32 slots: 77.31 normalized ON vs 84.54
# OFF). The prescribed fix (session-gating `is_tail` to the same NON-ZERO
# session) is now present verbatim in radix_tree/snapshot.rs::lookup, which is
# why this is worth retesting at all. But the ONLY way to know the fix holds is
# to run the regime that broke: many independent single-turn requests sharing a
# prefix. A latency probe cannot see this failure mode at all.
#
# The BFCL subset keeps the golden 62/10/10 category MIX (do-not-change) and
# scales all three down by the same factor, so the subset stays representative
# rather than reweighted.
