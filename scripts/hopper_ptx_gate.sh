# Does every Atlas kernel compile for a given SM architecture? Answered with
# nvcc alone — no H100, no B200, no GPU of any kind.
#
# Named for the campaign it was written for; it is not Hopper-specific and
# `--hw` takes any set under `kernels/`. (The name is left alone because CI and
# docs reference it, and a rename buys nothing a comment does not.)
#
# `nvcc --ptx` is a cross-compile: it emits device assembly for `-arch=sm_90a`
# on a host with no NVIDIA hardware present. `ptxas -v` then assembles that PTX
# for the same arch and reports register and spill pressure. Between them they
# answer "can this kernel exist on this architecture", which is the first
# question of a new hardware target and the only one that can be answered
# before the hardware arrives. They do NOT answer whether it is correct or
# fast; that needs the device.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/hopper_ptx_gate.sh [--hw hopper] [--model NAME|all] [--jobs N]
#                              [--arch sm_90a] [--nvcc PATH]
#                              [--out ledger.json] [--selftest] [--list-tasks]
#
#   --hw       hardware set under kernels/ (default: hopper)
#   --model    one model directory, or `all` for every model in the set
#   --jobs     parallel compiles (default: 4)
#   --arch     override the arch; default is HARDWARE.toml's `arch`
#   --nvcc     path to nvcc; else $NVCC_BIN, $CUDA_HOME/bin/nvcc, PATH,
#              /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
#   --out      ledger path (default: hopper_ptx_gate.json). A markdown summary
#              is written alongside it with the same basename and `.md`.
#   --strict   add `--Werror all-warnings`, matching what build.rs does. Use it
#              to predict whether the real kernel build would go green; leave it
#              off to ask only whether the instructions exist on this arch.
#   --list-tasks print the resolved (model, stem, source path) triples, one per
#              line, and exit. Needs no CUDA toolchain: it answers "which
#              sources would this gate compile", which is a question about the
#              tree. The source path is the DECLARED one, before symlink
#              resolution, so it can be read against `kernels/` directly.
#   --selftest run ONLY the self-test and exit
#
# The self-test runs first, always. It compiles two fixtures under
# scripts/fixtures/hopper_gate/ — one that must pass for any arch, one that
# must fail for this one — and if either verdict is wrong the gate refuses to
# report results at all. A gate whose failure path has never executed is not
# evidence.
#
# The NEGATIVE fixture is chosen per arch, because no one instruction is absent
# from every architecture Atlas targets. `redux.sync.max.abs.f32` is absent
# everywhere EXCEPT sm_100a; the warp-level `mma ... kind::mxf4nvf4
# .block_scale` is absent on sm_90a and sm_100a and present on sm_120/sm_121.
# An arch with no registered negative fixture is REFUSED, not waved through:
# running the gate without a working failure path is the thing this section
# exists to prevent.
#
# Exit status: 0 only if the self-test held AND every kernel compiled.
#
# `--Werror all-warnings`, which `build.rs` always adds ("clippy for kernels"),
# is OFF by default here and available as `--strict`. The default answers the
# narrower question — does the instruction selection exist on this
# architecture — where a promoted warning would make an unrelated diagnostic
# look like an ISA gap. `--strict` answers the other one: would the real build
# go green.
