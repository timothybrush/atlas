#
# SSOT for the coverage invocation: .github/workflows/coverage.yml calls this
# script rather than inlining the command, so a contributor running it locally
# and CI can never disagree about which files are excluded. Same rationale as
# scripts/ci_gpu_stubs.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/coverage.sh lcov.info                  # write LCOV + print the summary
#   COVERAGE_HTML=1 scripts/coverage.sh lcov.info  # ...also target/llvm-cov/html
#   scripts/coverage.sh lcov.info -p spark-server  # extra args go to the run
#
# HTML is an env var rather than a passed-through flag on purpose: cargo-llvm-cov
# rejects `--html` alongside `--lcov` ("--html may not be used together with
# --lcov"), so it has to be a second `report` pass over the same profdata.
#
# Requires: `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov` + `rustup component add
# llvm-tools-preview` (for the toolchain pinned in rust-toolchain.toml).

# Run and report are SPLIT on purpose (`clean` -> `--no-report` -> `report`,
# cargo-llvm-cov's documented multi-step flow). The single-shot form generates
# the report only on a zero exit, so one failing test would leave no lcov.info
# at all — and a red test suite is exactly when you want to see which code the
# surviving tests still cover. `clean` first because `--no-report` does not
# discard the previous run's .profraw the way the single-shot form does; without
# it a report would silently mix two runs.
#
# --no-fail-fast: a failing test must not stop the remaining test binaries from
#                 running, or the report covers only part of the tree.
# --locked:       same lockfile discipline as `cargo test --workspace --locked`.
#
# NOTE: `--no-fail-fast` and `--ignore-run-fail` are mutually exclusive in
# cargo-llvm-cov ("--ignore-run-fail may not be used together with
# --no-fail-fast"), so the test exit status is captured and re-raised at the end
# instead. A test failure therefore still fails this script — the report is
# produced first, not skipped. ci.yml's `test` job remains the real gate; this
# is redundancy, not a second gate.
#
# `--profraw-only` rather than a bare `clean --workspace`: the only thing that
# must not survive between runs is the previous run's raw profile data.
# `clean --workspace` ALSO deletes the compiled objects, which costs a full
# instrumented rebuild of ~340k LoC every single invocation — a real tax
# locally, and unnecessary here because cargo-llvm-cov builds into its own
# dedicated target dir, so every object in it is already instrumented.
