"""Generate the committed, copyright-free video fixtures for the video bench.

Four clips of solid colors, one color per second. Solid colors are the
point, not a shortcut: the assertion the whole benchmark rests on is "name the
colors in the order they appear", and a scene with any ambiguity in it makes
that answer a judgement call instead of a fact.

  01_colors_fwd.mp4   red, green, blue, yellow      4 s
  02_colors_rev.mp4   yellow, blue, green, red      4 s   (01 reversed)
  03_colors_fwd.gif   red, green, blue, yellow      4 s   (same as 01)
  04_colors_half.mp4  red, green                    2 s   (half of 01)
  05_colors_unit.mp4  red                           1 s   (quarter of 01)

WHY EACH ONE EXISTS:

* 01 vs 02 — the temporal-order assertion. Same geometry, same prompt, frames
  in the opposite order. If the answer does not reverse with them, the model
  is not reading the sequence; it is pattern-matching the question. This pair
  is what caught the 2026-08-14 splice bug, where video pad tokens received no
  encoder rows at all and the model answered "gray, gray, gray..." while every
  token count looked perfect.
* 01 vs 03 — backend parity. The MP4 goes through ffmpeg, the GIF decodes
  in-process in pure Rust. Identical content must produce identical geometry,
  or the two paths disagree.
* 05, 04, 01 — the geometry assertion, at 1x/2x/4x. THREE durations, not two:
  two measurements cannot test proportionality at all, because the implied
  template overhead absorbs any discrepancy and a line always fits two points.
  With three, `t4 - t2 == 2 * (t2 - t1)` is a claim that can fail, and it is
  independent of both the overhead and the tokens-per-group figure — so it
  holds whatever `--video-fps` the server was started with.

224x224 to match the image ladder: at patch 16 / merge 2 that is a 14x14 patch
grid and 49 merged tokens per temporal group, so the arithmetic stays easy to
check by hand.

Usage:  python3 scripts/gen_test_videos.py     (needs ffmpeg for the MP4s)

# ★ GREEN IS FULL-BRIGHT (0,255,0), NOT HTML/CSS green (0,128,0).
#
# It was (0,128,0) until 2026-08-15 — the one HALF-INTENSITY colour among three
# full-bright ones, because ffmpeg and CSS both resolve the NAME "green" to
# #008000. That made the benchmark measure colour sensitivity instead of frame
# order. MEASURED on Qwen3.8-27B, same server, same prompt, same clip recipe,
# the shade the only variable:
#
#     #008000  ->  "Red, Blue, Yellow"          (green dropped, 2/2 runs)
#     #00FF00  ->  "Red, Green, Blue, Yellow"   (correct, 2/2 runs)
#
# Qwen3.6-27B read #008000 correctly, so the dim band cost nothing there and
# the difficulty stayed invisible until a weaker checkpoint became the gate's
# subject. Nothing about the assertion changes: the reversed pair, the
# geometry ladder and the parity pair are all untouched, and the answer is
# still the word "green" — which is also a substring of "bright green" and
# "lime green", so a model that reaches for those still scores.
#
# These values are the single source of truth for BOTH the MP4s and the GIF.
# The MP4 generator used to pass the ffmpeg colour NAME, so the two encoders
# agreed only by coincidence of CSS naming; now they read the same dict.

    TWO frames per color, because the MP4 yields two frames per color once the
    server samples it at 2 fps, and `temporal_patch_size = 2` then pairs them
    into one group per color. A GIF with one frame per color is a DIFFERENT
    clip: its groups straddle color boundaries (red+green, blue+yellow), and a
    model reading it correctly reports "red, blue". That is what the first
    version of this fixture produced, and it read as an engine bug when it was
    a fixture bug.

    The single tweaked corner pixel is what makes the duplicates survive. PIL
    merges byte-identical consecutive frames — with or without `optimize` — so
    eight frames became four with doubled durations. One flipped low bit in the
    red channel of the bottom-right pixel defeats the merge; it is one pixel in
    50176, invisible to the encoder's 16x16 patching after normalization, and
