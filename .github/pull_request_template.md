<!--
Thanks for contributing to Atlas! A few reminders:

- Read CONTRIBUTING.md if you haven't yet.
- CI runs cargo fmt, cargo clippy -Dwarnings, the SPDX-header check, typos,
  and cargo-deny (via the security workflow). Please run `cargo fmt --all`
  and `bash scripts/check-license-headers.sh` locally before pushing.
- If you add a new source file, it needs `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only`
  on line 1.
