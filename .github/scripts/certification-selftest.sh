# then trusted forever.

# EVERY check here has a NEGATIVE CONTROL: the guard is shown failing on input
# it must reject, not merely passing on input it should accept. A guard that has

# The guard is hosted here, in a required context, rather than in either
# workflow's own lane: a job cannot be relied on to notice it has been unwired
