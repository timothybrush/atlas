"""Assert that jobs whose verdict is supposed to gate something actually do.

Two instances of one defect prompted this, and they were found a wave apart:

  #810  `Site unit tests` ran on every PR, reported green, and blocked neither
        the merge nor the deploy. It was not a required context, and `deploy`
        declared `needs: build` alone. A latching-state regression (#805)
        reached main during exactly that window.

  the merge-ancestry guard  `Merge-ancestry guard self-test` -- the test that
        proves the guard CAN fail -- was a required context, while `PR shares
        history with its base`, the guard's actual verdict on your branch, was
        not. An orphan-history PR (the #452 class, which squash-merges a diff
        that silently reverts everything before it) went red and merged anyway.

A check that reports without gating is worse than no check, because it reads as
safety. What this file pins:

  * `needed_by` -- some other job must refuse to run if this one failed. This
    is the half of "gating" that a file in the tree can express.

  * unconditionality -- the job must carry no `if:` and no `needs:`, and its
    workflow's `pull_request` trigger must carry no `paths:` filter. This is
    NOT a stylistic preference. A required context is only satisfiable if the
    job is *created*; a job held behind an `if:` is never created for the runs
    it skips, and GitHub blocks on it forever. Five workflows here carry that
    scar. So the assertion guards the fix from becoming the outage.

  * `merge_group` -- if the job is meant to be a required context, it must
    report in the merge queue too, or every queue entry deadlocks.

The other half of gating -- membership in `main`'s required-context list --
lives in branch protection, which no committed file can express. See
docs/ROBUSTNESS.md for the API call and the before/after diff.
