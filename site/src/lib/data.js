      q: 'Is Atlas faster than vLLM on a DGX Spark?',
      a: 'On the published concurrency ladder, yes at every rung from C=1 to C=128, by 1.012x to 1.225x against whichever vLLM configuration is faster at that concurrency. The margin is widest at the top, because between C=64 and C=128 Atlas keeps scaling and the vLLM configuration that leads the mid-ladder stops. Same box, same checkpoint, same client, same prompts, greedy sampling with matched penalties. The full campaign log, including the rungs we lost on the way, is in the repo.'
    },
    {
      q: 'How do I install it?',
      a: 'One command: curl -fsSL https://atlasinference.io/install.sh | sh. It downloads a prebuilt atlasctl, verifies its checksum, and installs to ~/.local/bin. If you would rather not pipe curl to a shell, cargo install atlasctl does the same thing from source.'
    },

      q: 'Which models can I run?',
      a: 'Every model on this page maps to a recipe in the atlas-recipes repository, which is the single source of truth — the site cannot list a model that has no recipe. Qwen3.6 is the flagship family, alongside Gemma, Nemotron, Mistral, MiniMax and DeepSeek.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What does “verified” mean here?',
      a: 'An image ships only after the serve matrix passes: every model boots, stays coherent under greedy determinism with no token leakage and reliable tool calls, and holds throughput within 10% of its committed baseline. A release that ships slower than its baseline fails the gate.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Why does concurrency matter more than single-stream speed?',
      a: 'Because agentic systems do not send one request at a time. A fleet of tool-calling agents sharing a context bus arrives as many concurrent streams, so the engine is judged where the requests pile up. On the published ladder Atlas keeps gaining throughput from C=64 to C=128 while the leading vLLM configuration does not, and an engine that flattens under load caps how many agents a given box can actually run.'
