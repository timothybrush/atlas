  // What the operator sees while the fleet is still being assembled.

  // Three things, because they are three halves of one question — "where are my
  // machines?":
  //   1. that discovery is running, and is passive rather than stalled
  //   2. which networks THIS machine is on, since that is what discovery can
  //      reach and it is the first thing to check when nothing appears
  //   3. a way to name a machine directly, for when discovery cannot reach it
  //
  // (3) is not a fallback for a broken (1). Discovery is mDNS, which is
  // link-local by design: it does not cross a router, and plenty of managed
  // networks drop multicast outright. A machine one hop away is invisible to it
  // and perfectly reachable by address.
  //
  // House rule, as in ClusterLaunch: the rules live in tested modules
  // (`network.js`), and this file is only a surface.

      <HelpDot label="How to reach machines on another network">
        <p>
          Discovery uses mDNS, which does not cross a router. A machine on a
          network this one cannot see will never appear on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way to reach it is to install the agent on a machine that sits on
          <em>both</em> networks — one interface on your LAN, one on the far
          subnet — and pair with that machine. It becomes the middle node: it
          can see its own neighbours and reports them here, and control of them
          is carried through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two DGX Sparks joined by RoCE are the usual case. Pair with the one
          your laptop can reach; the machines behind it on the fabric follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pairing itself stays between neighbours — each hop trusts the machine
          it can actually reach — so a middle node vouches for what is behind
          it rather than handing over its keys.
