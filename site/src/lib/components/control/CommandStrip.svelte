  // Left, identity and trust: the Atlas mark (the way back to the site the
  // rest of this surface deliberately is not), the connection chip, and the

  // identity must never wear a verified pin's clothes.
  //
  // Center, the worst live alert verbatim. Clicking it selects the node, so
  // the loudest problem is one action from its machine.
  //
  // Right, the telemetry range chip: what this page can show is this session,
  // and the 1h/24h segments are registered placeholders that say exactly what
  // is missing (an agent ring buffer and a query verb).
  //
  // This strip also hosts THE page's one aria-live region. Everything else on
  // the surface renders silently; only a change in worst severity is worth
  // interrupting a screen-reader user for, and `announce.js` decides that.
  // The timer here only lets the fleet settle before the sentence is read.

  // each tick cancelled the pending announcement while the severity had already

  // carrying telemetry, which is every real one. Quiet wires announced fine,
  // which is exactly why it survived being tried by hand.
