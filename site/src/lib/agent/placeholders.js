//
// A placeholder is the fourth honesty class: dashed outline, `soon` chip, and
// NO value — not even an em-dash, because the dash means "this hardware
// cannot answer", which would be a claim about a question that was never
// asked. Each entry names the specific missing capability in one sentence,
// shown in a popover, so "soon" is a statement rather than marketing.
//
// The per-region caps exist because placeholders multiply: each one alone is
// honest, and a console covered in them reads as a roadmap. The cap is
// enforced HERE, where entries are registered, so adding a fourth actions
// chip fails a test instead of quietly densifying the UI.
//
// Deliberately absent, even as a placeholder: remote shell, raw exec, agent
// restart, reboot. The control vocabulary is a closed enum; a "soon" chip for
// an open-proxy verb would promise exactly what the security model exists to
// prevent.
