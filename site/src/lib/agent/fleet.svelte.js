// One fleet session for the whole app: the /control page and the nav indicator
// share it, so there is exactly one socket to the local agent.
//
// UNTRUSTED INPUT POLICY. Hostnames, agent versions, alert detail and address
// strings all originate from an unauthenticated multicast beacon or from a peer,
// and this is a public website rendering them. Rules, applied once at ingestion
// rather than at every render site:
//
//   1. Svelte text interpolation only. Never {@html}, never into href/src/style.
//   2. Control characters, ANSI escapes and bidi overrides are stripped. The
//      bidi ones matter: without them a hostname can visually reverse the
//      fingerprint printed next to it.
//   3. Everything is length-capped here, not by CSS. An unbounded string is a
//      denial of service against the layout.
//   4. Hostnames are display-only. Every keyed operation — the node map,
//      selection, pairing, launching — uses the fingerprint, because Sparks
//      ship with colliding names like spark-256a.
//
// PRIVACY. Fleet data lives in memory for the life of the tab, and the
// prerendered page contains no fleet data at all.
//
// ONE fleet value does reach a URL, and it is worth stating rather than
// leaving the older blanket claim to rot: the control page persists the
// SELECTED node's fingerprint as `#node=<64-hex>` via `replaceState`, so a
// reload or a deep link returns to the machine you were looking at. That
// fingerprint is a public key hash, not a secret — it is broadcast in mDNS
// beacons on the LAN — but it does enter browser history and travels if the
// URL is pasted. It is `replaceState`, so it does not accumulate entries.
// Two things are written to storage, both by other modules and neither by this
// one: the browser-pairing token (`protocol.js`) and the operator's own
// preferences (`profile.js`). The latter includes the fingerprints of machines
// the operator selected themselves — see that file for why that is the one
// fleet value worth persisting. Names, addresses, vitals and alerts are not.
