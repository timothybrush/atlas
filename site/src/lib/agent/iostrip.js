// **Absent is never zero, and absence comes in kinds.** A tile can be:
//   reading      the wire carried a value — 0 renders as 0 only here
//   pending      no reading has arrived yet — skeleton, "waiting for first sample"
//   absent       a reading arrived and this field was not in it — em-dash,
//                "the engine does not report this"
//   placeholder  the protocol itself has no field yet (ISL/OSL) — no value at
//                all, not even a dash; a dash would claim the engine was asked
// Collapsing any two of these teaches the operator that the dashboard guesses.
