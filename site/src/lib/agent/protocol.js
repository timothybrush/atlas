// The wire contract with the local agent.
//
// Mirrors crates/atlasctl-protocol in atlas-recipes. Kept deliberately small:
// the whole surface a page can reach is a handful of message types, and that is
// the point. There is no raw-command verb, no nested-message verb and no relay
// of opaque bytes, and the enum is closed — an unknown `type` fails to
// deserialize rather than reaching a handler.
//
// One scoped exception, stated here so this file cannot outgrow the doctrine it
// mirrors: the seven single-node control verbs carry an optional `on` target,
// which the agent honours by re-issuing the request AS ITSELF over its
// authenticated peer channel — one hop, only toward a machine it has itself
// pinned AND whose pin of the requester carries an explicit `controller` grant.
// Forwarding is an ANNOTATION on closed verbs, never a wrapper around arbitrary
// messages: the forwardable vocabulary cannot express pairing, joining, cluster
// reservation, or a further hop. That is what still keeps the agent from being
// an open proxy for whatever page is talking to it.

// 2: pairing became two-phase. `pair_peer` runs the exchange and writes no
// pin; `confirm_pairing` establishes trust and `reject_pairing` discards it.
// `pair_result.paired` became `.exchanged` because it no longer means trusted.
// The agent enforces an exact match, so a page still on 1 is refused at the
// handshake rather than reading `exchanged` as "trusted" and showing a machine
// as paired that the agent has not accepted.
//
// 4: control verbs gained an optional `on` target and the replies gained
// `on`/`via`, so a page can drive a machine reached through a peer. See the
// doctrine note above for what that deliberately cannot do.
//
// 3: `pair_peer_at` added, so a machine can be added by typing its address.
// mDNS is link-local — it does not cross a router and is off on plenty of
// managed networks — so without it the page could only reach machines on one
// broadcast domain. Additive, but the handshake is exact-match by design.
