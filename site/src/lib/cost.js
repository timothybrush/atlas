//
// # Store joules and tokens, derive every ratio
//
// The producer (crates/avarok-plugin/src/hardware/energy.rs) stores JOULES and
// the TOKEN COUNT of the window they span, and nothing else: joules and tokens
// are additive and survive re-aggregation, a ratio does not. So J/token,
// tokens/Wh and dollars are computed HERE, from that pair, and none of them is
// ever read from a record.
//
//   J/token   = energy_j / tokens
//   tok/Wh    = tokens / energy_j × 3600
//   W         = energy_j / window_s
//   $/1M tok  = J/token × ($/kWh) / 3.6
//
// tokens/W and tokens/J are the SAME quantity — `(tok/s) / (J/s) = tok/J` — so
// only one efficiency unit appears on an axis anywhere in the section.
//
// # The rail is in every key name, and it is a LOWER BOUND
//
// On GB10 `nvidia-smi` exposes the GPU rail only: `power.limit`, Module Power
// Readings and GPU Memory Power all answer N/A, so Grace's cores and the
// LPDDR5X are OUTSIDE every number here. The producer puts `gpu_rail` in each

//
// # Four things a reader must never be able to misread
//
//   * an ABSENT key is "not measured", never 0 — a zero joule count reads as
//     FREE, which is the one thing this section must not claim;
//   * an UNDER-SAMPLED window is marked and left out of every tile, verdict
//     and trend line, but stays visible — silently averaging it would launder
//     a guess into a measurement;
//   * two measurements on different instruments are never joined (the
//     `ladder-baselines.js` rule, plus the rail and the sampler cadence);
//   * a LOSING rung is drawn exactly like a winning one. There is no filter
//     and no default view that hides one.
